// §V834 / T1061 — a backtick inside WGSL text ends the TypeScript template
// literal that holds the shader. Four casualties now; the last one (backticks
// around `mix` in switch.wgsl.ts) 500'd the whole dev bundle and was chased
// TWICE as a transient, because a module that fails to load surfaces in vitest
// as `FAIL [ file ]` with no test failures at all.
//
// WHAT THIS RULE CAN AND CANNOT SEE, stated rather than implied.
//
// The FATAL form is an UNESCAPED backtick: it terminates the template, the rest
// of the shader is read as TypeScript, and the file stops parsing. No lint rule
// ever runs on a file that does not parse — ESLint reports it as a bare
// `Parsing error: ',' expected`, which is red but anonymous, and anonymous is
// how it got chased twice. That half of §V834 is already caught by `pnpm lint`
// and cannot be improved from inside a rule.
//
// What IS reachable, and what this rule owns, is the ESCAPED form `\``: legal
// TypeScript, invisible in review, and one deleted backslash away from the
// fatal one. Every casualty so far started as somebody writing a backtick in
// WGSL prose, so the habit is the thing to remove — there is no correct use of
// a backtick inside a shader string, and the escaped spelling only teaches the
// hand the wrong motion.
//
// An odd-backtick-count heuristic on the file was the cheaper option offered in
// §T1061 and it is NOT what this is, for a measured reason: casualty #4 wrote a
// PAIR of backticks, so the count stayed even and the heuristic would have
// missed the exact bug it was written for. (Every `.wgsl.ts` in the tree has an

// §V1028 / B246 — LAYERING ZONES: a directory (or one module) that may not import another.
//
// B246: `src/domain/parameters/node-references.ts` imported a VALUE from
// `src/domain/presets/morph-index.ts` and read it at module scope. The presets layer imports
// the parameter read path, so that one line closed a cycle, and a constant read across a
// cycle is uninitialised whenever the far side happens to load first: every plain-node entry
// point died at import with `Cannot access 'NO_MORPHS' before initialization`, while Vitest —
// whose files load other modules first — stayed green. The rule it broke was already written
// down, in `resolve.ts`'s own docblock ("this module never imports the presets layer"). A
// boundary defended by a paragraph decays (§V901); these are those paragraphs, as a table.
//
// WHY A RULE OF ITS OWN and not `no-restricted-imports`, which §V3/§V11/§V901 use:
//  - a zone is about where a specifier LANDS, and one target has three spellings here
//    (`../presets/x.ts`, `@domain/presets/x.ts`, `@/domain/presets/x.ts`). This resolves the
//    specifier through the alias table in tsconfig.app.json (the one `src/tooling/alias-hooks.ts`
//    reads) and matches the resolved path, so no gitignore-style pattern has to guess — and
//    none can match a `presets` segment that belongs to somebody else;
//  - it sees every form that reaches a module in one visitor: `import`, `export … from`,
//    `import()`, `require()` and the type query `import("…").T`. The core rule sees static
//    declarations only, which is the hole §V3 and §V901 each had to close by hand;
//  - zones overlap (a file under src/domain/parameters is in three of them) and flat config
//    REPLACES a rule's value on overlap. A rule with its own id cannot be silently dropped by
//    the next `no-restricted-imports` block that happens to match the same files.
//
// TYPE-ONLY IMPORTS ARE REFUSED TOO, and that is a decision, not an oversight. `import type`
// is erased and cannot by itself cause an initialisation-order failure. But:
//  (1) the rule as written is about DIRECTION: the lower layer declares what it needs
//      (`ParameterMorphs`, `ParentBindResolver` in resolve.ts) and the upper layer implements
//      it. A type imported from above moves the declaration's home up, which is the inversion;
//  (2) MEASURED (Node 24 type stripping, which follows `verbatimModuleSyntax`): `import type
//      { X } from` is erased, but `import { type X } from` is NOT — it survives as a bare
//      module load, a real edge that closes the cycle with no value in sight. Two spellings a
//      keystroke apart, one of them harmless, is not a distinction to leave to review.
// Every zone below was already free of both spellings when it landed, so the strict form
// cost nothing.
//
// TESTS ARE EXEMPT for §V901's reason: the boundary is about what PRODUCTION modules reach, a
// test file is always its own first module, and no product entry point's graph contains one.
// `test-support.ts` is NOT a test file here — it is a module other modules import, and it is
// one of the two files B246's fix had to change.
//
// ADD A ZONE when a docblock says "never imports" / "may not import" AND it is true today.
// One that is false today is a refactor, not a lint rule: `src/domain/** ↛ src/compiler/**`
// (stated in presets/morph-index.ts) is the open one — `commands/validate-command.ts` imports
// the compiler, and that edge is what joins the compiler and the domain into one cycle.
