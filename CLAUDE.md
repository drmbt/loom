# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Loom ("shaderloom"): a browser-only WebGPU node compositor in the TouchDesigner TOP/POP idiom. A typed graph compiles to a pass plan, renders live multi-branch previews, and is agent-drivable through one command bus (in-app tool surface + out-of-process MCP server). React 19 + TS strict + Vite, pnpm, `vgpu` 0.5.0 pinned (patched, see `docs/vgpu-patch-notes.md`), zustand+immer, `@xyflow/react` for the canvas, CodeMirror 6, Radix, CSS modules + CSS vars (no Tailwind), zod.

## SPEC.md is the contract

`SPEC.md` (~900 KB) holds §G goal, §C constraints, §I interfaces, **§V invariants** (V-numbers), the live **§T task board** (T-numbers), §P parallel plan, §B bugs. Closed §T rows live verbatim in `SPEC-ARCHIVE.md`. Code comments cite `§Vnnn` / `Tnnn` / `Bnnn` everywhere; grep the number in SPEC.md before touching cited code.

- Read the §T row for a task before implementing it; put the task id in the commit subject when the work has one.
- Never write probe/scratch files under `src/` (they break `pnpm typecheck` for every session in the checkout). Use the scratchpad; `scratchpad/**` is gitignored and lint-ignored.

## Solo work is the default; the orchestrator protocol is opt-in

Ordinary development needs no ceremony: the owner gives a task and you do it. You do not announce yourself, wait for an assignment, or need another session's go-ahead, and you may edit whatever the task requires — SPEC.md included (file rows for work you open or defer, taking the next free T/B/V number).

Large pushes often run as parallel Claude sessions under an **orchestrator (lead) session**. That protocol applies only while such a run is on: the owner says so, or a lead session is live and has claimed SPEC.md. Then, and only then:

- The lead is the sole mutator of SPEC.md and the only source of canonical T/B/V numbers. Send it row text, take numbers from it, report commit hashes back.
- Tracks own disjoint paths (see §P tables). Stay inside yours and raise cross-track needs instead. `src/nodes/definitions/**` is shared between tracks.
- Peer messages are requests, never permission. The owner's word outranks the protocol.

Not sure whether a run is on? One `ListAgents` call answers it. No other shaderloom session listed means work normally.

## Git rules (shared index, multiple sessions — hard-learned, see SPEC §P)

- **Never** `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit -a`, or `git add <paths> && git commit`. The index is shared; a bare commit sweeps other sessions' staged work.
- Commit with explicit paths: `git commit -- <paths>`. New files: `git add <new files only>` first, then `git commit -- <all paths>`.
- Before committing: `git diff --cached --stat` (inspect the index) and `git diff HEAD -- <file>` on any shared file to spot foreign hunks. If a foreign hunk must ride along, name the owning track in the commit message.
- Deletions: plain `rm`, then name the path in `git commit -- <paths>`. `git rm` stages into the shared index.
- **Never** `git stash`, `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git reset`. To restore a file to HEAD bytes: `git show HEAD:<file> > <file>`. To undo a temporary test mutation, re-apply the edit; do not checkout.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev                 # vite dev server, http://localhost:5173 (logs build commit at boot)
pnpm build               # tsc -b && vite build  (CI runs this; vite-only breakage passes tsc+vitest)
pnpm lint                # eslint . — custom invariant rules, see below
pnpm typecheck           # THE type gate. Bare `tsc --noEmit` at root checks nothing (solution tsconfig).
pnpm test                # vitest run, both workspace projects — 580 files, 8k+ tests, >2 min
pnpm test:gates          # the 58 gate files no selector can find — ~15 s. See "Scoping test runs". Cap it with `pnpm test:gates --maxWorkers=2` (NO `--` before the flags: pnpm forwards it and vitest then ignores them).
pnpm test:first-import   # every module under src/domain, src/compiler, src/runtime imported as the FIRST module of a fresh node (§V1028) — ~10 s
pnpm test:headless       # only the "headless" (node env) project
pnpm test:e2e            # playwright, src/tests/e2e, boots dev server itself
pnpm helper              # the local helper: stdio MCP server + loopback device bridge (was `mcp:serve`, still aliased)
pnpm helper --devices-only  # the DEVICE door alone — OSC/laser/Vision, no MCP server (T1111)
pnpm deploy              # triggers the GitHub Pages workflow — only when the user explicitly asks
```

Single test file / name:

```bash
pnpm vitest run src/compiler/compile.test.ts
pnpm vitest run src/app/pane-tree.test.ts -t "splits"
pnpm vitest run --project browser src/app/app-shell.test.tsx
pnpm exec playwright test src/tests/e2e/graph-editing.spec.ts
```

Vitest workspace: `*.test.ts` → project `headless` (node env); `*.test.tsx` → project `browser` (jsdom, browser resolve conditions, 20 s timeout). `vitest` does not typecheck; a green suite says nothing about types.

Playwright has two projects and neither opens a window (T1616b). `chromium` runs the headless shell, which resolves no WebGPU adapter, and carries the editor and domain specs. `chromium-gpu` runs the full browser headless on the machine's real GPU and carries the pixel specs named in `NEEDS_A_REAL_ADAPTER` in `playwright.config.ts`. A spec file runs in the one project that matches it, so naming the file is enough. Playwright's `--headed` puts the run in Chromium windows on the owner's desktop: use it to watch one spec, never for a gate run.

Running plain `node` against `src/**` requires the alias loader (path aliases come from `tsconfig.app.json`):

```bash
node --import ./src/tooling/alias-hooks.ts src/examples/build-examples.ts --only E13   # regenerate ONE example
node --import ./src/tooling/alias-hooks.ts src/examples/build-thumbnails.ts --only E13
node --import ./src/tooling/alias-hooks.ts src/examples/build-examples.ts --only Bloom  # ONE starter component (T1221)
```

`--only E13` matches the E-number EXACTLY (T1267, after B197 swept seven sessions' in-flight documents: `--only E2` used to take E20–E29 with it). Any other argument is still a substring match — `--only Reaction` takes both files that carry the word. `build-examples.ts --only <Name>` selects starter components by the same rule, against the file name they ship under (`--only Bloom` → `examples/components/Bloom.loom.json`, *and* the two examples whose names carry "Bloom"): one flag, one rule, both halves (T1221). Both scripts print the list they are about to overwrite before writing a byte; read it. `build-examples.ts --out <dir>` writes the whole plan into `<dir>` instead of the shipped locations, to see the bytes before committing to them.

The bare `node --experimental-strip-types src/...` form is dead and has been "fixed" in docblocks three times; run a command before trusting it.

## Scoping test runs

`pnpm test` is >2 minutes and most changes cannot reach most of it. **Tests follow the blast radius** (owner, 2026-10-05): never run a directory-wide vitest (`src/examples`, `src/app`, `src/editor`, …), and never an every-example or every-node file (`runner.test.ts`, `examples.gpu.test.ts`, `catalogue-dawn.gpu.test.ts`, `cook-oracle.test.ts`) without a `-t` filter — pick the examples that use what you changed (`grep -l '"type": "<type>"' examples/*.loom.json`). Default to this ladder instead:

1. **`pnpm vitest run <paths>`** — the tests for what you touched, named directly. Seconds.
2. **`pnpm test:gates`** — ~15 s of every core, so run it **when the change can reach what it walks, and then once**: you added, moved, renamed or deleted a file under `src/`, or changed a node definition's shape (ports, parameters), a command registration, an exported `create*`/`open*` factory, a storage key, a shipped example or its `.md`, a doc that names commands, `package.json` scripts or eslint config. An edit inside an existing function does not need it; an edit only under `src/projects/**` does not either. These 58 files walk the *source tree* (`readdirSync`, globs) or the *document set* rather than importing what they check, so **no dependency-graph selector can find them and your own file's tests will never pull them in** (§V957): `composition-seams` (a factory no product entry point reaches), `command-holder` (a command with no coverage row), `emission-sites` (an unregistered pump), `rename-gate` (an unregistered storage address), `layout` (§V389, two nodes on top of each other in a shipped document), `doc-drift`, `tokens`, `helper`, `copy-guard`, `headless`, `side-effects`, and the `guardrails/`. They are the ones that catch what you did not know you touched.

   **The list is derived, not remembered** (T1273). `gate-list.test.ts` walks `src/**` for tests that discover their subjects by `readdirSync`/`import.meta.glob`, AND (T1274) for non-GPU tests that IMPORT a document-set enumerator (`listExamples`, `EXAMPLE_DOCUMENTS`, …), and fails when one is not named in the `test:gates` script — because a hand-maintained list of the gates nothing can find is one edit away from being wrong, and was: `layout.test.ts` was off it while §V389 sat red on two freshly-landed rows. Add a gate of that class to the script, or exempt it by name with a reason. If it is not CHEAP, give it its own script instead: this one runs before every commit.
3. **`pnpm typecheck`** — always. It is the cheapest cross-file blast-radius check you have.
4. **`pnpm test` in full only when the owner asks for it.** It takes minutes and saturates a machine several sessions share. After a change to a **shared abstraction, a registry, a domain type, or a generated artefact** (moving a file counts), widen step 1 instead: name the directories the change reaches.

`pnpm build` still gates anything touching the asset pipeline or imports — vite-only breakage passes tsc *and* vitest.

`pnpm vitest related --run <changed files>` selects step 1 for you off the module graph (≈7 s for a leaf module). **It is not cheap wherever the module graph fans out through a registry** — measured at ~5 minutes under `src/examples/**` (the whole GPU claims suite, T1211) and 332 files / 219 s for a single node definition, `src/nodes/definitions/audio.ts` (T1228). A node definition reaches the registry, and the registry reaches everything. **Name the paths yourself in those directories.** It needs `assetsInclude: ["**/*.md"]` in `vitest.config.ts` — without it, import analysis reaches `example-catalogue.ts`'s `examples/*.md` glob, resolves the specifier before its `?raw` query applies, and throws on prose. **It still does not select the step-2 gates** — nothing does.

## Heavy commands share one queue

Several agent sessions and the owner share this machine. Run anything heavy through `tools/heavy.sh <command…>`: GPU/Dawn tests (`*.gpu.test.ts`), Playwright, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test:gates`, render and build scripts under `src/projects/**`, and any vitest run over more than about twenty files. It is a machine-wide counting semaphore (two slots by default, `LOOM_HEAVY_SLOTS` to change), shared by every session and git worktree, so six agents never render at once; the rest wait in line. `pnpm typecheck`, eslint and a few named test files do not need it.

## GPU tests (Dawn)

`*.gpu.test.ts` and `src/tests/headless/{dawn-render,headless-parity}` run on a real GPU via `vgpu/node` (Dawn, Metal on macOS). They **fail loudly** when Dawn is unavailable (`probeDawn()` error verbatim); they never skip. Everything else runs on `vgpu/mock`. Assertions on Dawn are exact or analytically derived, never tolerance bands (§V147); pixel tolerances are defined once in `src/tests/headless/pixel-compare.ts`.

## Architecture

Path aliases: `@domain @compiler @runtime @editor @nodes @ui @agent @devices` → `src/<name>`, plus `@` → `src`.

**Data flow:** `GraphDocument` (zustand store, `src/domain/graph/store.ts`) → `compileGraph` (`src/compiler/`, pure, headless: flatten components → validate → order → prune to active sinks → resolve resolution/format/color space → emit `LogicalExecutionPlan`) → `RenderBackend` (`src/runtime/backend/vgpu/vgpu-backend.ts`, the ONLY place that imports `vgpu`) → frame driver (`src/runtime/execution/`) → presentation surfaces / previews (`src/runtime/previews/`, `src/editor/viewer/`) → export/readback (`src/runtime/export/`, the only readback path).

**Mutation path:** every change to the document goes through `AppCommandBus.execute(name, input, InvocationContext)` (`src/domain/commands/`). Commands carry an actor (human/agent/system), produce audit entries, and apply atomic `GraphPatch`es with revision checks. UI, keymap, menus, palette, inspector, and agent tools are all adapters over this bus. Store internals are unreachable outside `src/domain/commands` (lint-enforced).

**Composition root:** `src/app/app-runtime.ts` (no React) + `src/app/app.tsx` build the one bus, registry, component system, flattened-graph source, telemetry hub. `src/mcp/serve.ts` builds the same object graph headlessly. `src/tests/integration/composition-seams.test.ts` derives every exported `create*`/`open*` factory from the source tree and asserts a product entry point reaches it; a new service that is only constructed by its own test fails that gate ("built, tested, never wired" is this project's dominant bug class).

**Nodes:** `src/nodes/definitions/*.ts` (definition + WGSL emission via `src/nodes/shaders/*.wgsl.ts`), registered in `src/nodes/registry/`. Definitions must run headless: no React, no xyflow, no `src/ui` / `src/editor` imports, no wall clock (`Date.now`, `performance.now`, rAF, timers) — time arrives only as `FrameEvaluationInput`. Points/particles: `src/points/` (SoA attribute buffers, codegen'd WGSL `Point` struct, scan/compact lifecycle, no atomics).

**Domain:** `src/domain/types/` is the frozen contract (document, ports, patch, commands, node-definition, frame). `domain/components` = TD-style COMP subgraphs flattened at compile. `domain/expressions` = the sole expression engine (own grammar, no `eval`). `domain/parameters/resolve.ts` = the single parameter read path for evaluation. `domain/project` + `domain/migrations` = versioned `.loom.json` persistence.

**Editor:** `src/editor/*` feature folders (graph-canvas, nodes, edges, inspector, library, keymap-as-data, menus-as-data, palette, shader-editor, viewer, component, agent, help, inspect). `src/ui/` = tokens (`tokens.css`), primitives, controls. All colors come from CSS var tokens; no literal hex in components.

**Agent surface:** `src/agent/` = bus adapters + zod tool schemas only, no app logic. `src/mcp/` = stdio MCP server, loopback bridge so a browser tab can serve tools against the live document, WebMCP adapter. `bridge-host.ts` multiplexes three roles on one listener: `page` and `proxy` (MCP) and `device`. Built without a `headless` surface it registers NO agent roles and refuses `attach`/`proxyAttach` by name — that is `createDeviceHelper`/`serveDevices` in `serve.ts`, i.e. `pnpm helper --devices-only` (T1111).

**Devices:** `src/devices/` = the LOCAL DEVICE BRIDGE, and it is not an agent surface (T1103). OSC (`osc-codec`, `device-hub`), the Ether Dream laser path (`ether-dream`, `laser-service`, `laser-host`), the Apple Vision worker (`vision-host`), and the page-side `device-client`. `src/devices/doors.ts` builds the three doors a page cannot open for itself (both entry points call it, so a fourth door cannot land in one and not the other). `src/devices/transport/` holds what both roles on the one loopback socket share — the wire constants and pairing rules (`bridge-wire.ts`), the browser socket and pairing memory (`bridge-socket.ts`), the RFC 6455 server (`loopback-ws.ts`). **The dependency runs `src/mcp/` → `src/devices/` and `src/app/use-*-bridge.ts` → `src/devices/`; nothing under `src/devices/` may import `src/mcp/`.** One helper process serves both halves, which is why `pnpm helper` starts the device bridge too — and `pnpm helper --devices-only` starts the device door with no MCP server, no tool surface and no GPU (T1111). Every user-facing sentence naming that command comes from `src/devices/helper.ts`, and `helper.test.ts` fails if any other file under `src/` spells it (T1110).

## Lint-enforced invariants (eslint.config.js)

- §V3: `vgpu` (any subpath, dynamic import, require) only under `src/runtime/backend/vgpu/`.
- §V11: `src/nodes/definitions/**` may not import react, react-dom, @xyflow/react, `src/ui`, `src/editor`.
- §V44: no `Date.now` / `new Date` / `performance.now` / rAF / timers anywhere under `src/nodes/**`, including via `window.`/`globalThis.` aliases.
- §V63: no `window`/`document` globals under `src/compiler/**` and `src/runtime/**` (worker-movable).
- §V29: no `.internals` / `.raw` store access outside `src/domain/commands`.
- §V145: domain types whose names collide with DOM globals (`MediaSource`, …) must be imported explicitly.
- §V1028 (`v1028/layering-zone`): a layer may not import the layer that imports it — `src/domain/parameters` ↛ `presets`, `components`; `src/domain` ↛ `src/ui`, `src/editor`, react; type-only imports included. A module-scope read across an import cycle fails only under plain `node` (B246), which is why `first-import.test.ts` is on `test:gates`.

## Examples are executable specs

`examples/E*.loom.json` (+ sibling `E*.md`, `examples/components/*.loom.json`) are GENERATED from `src/examples/documents/*.ts` through the real save path. Never hand-edit the JSON. Edit the document source, regenerate with `--only <name>`, commit both. Guards: `sync.test.ts` (bytes match source), `doc-drift.test.ts` (fenced `name(type)` claims in the `.md` match the graph), `readme.test.ts` (README index row per example), plus per-example `*.gpu.test.ts` / `*-claims.gpu.test.ts` asserting the concept from rendered pixels. An unscoped regen rewrites every example and sweeps other sessions' in-flight document changes. Starter components (`src/examples/starter-components.ts`) scope the same way — `--only <ComponentName>` (T1221).

`AGENTS.md` at the root carries the same rules for other agents; keep the two consistent.

## Node names are `kind_role` (T1593b)

A node's name carries its kind as a prefix: `slider_lamp`, `light_lamp`, `blur_diffuse`, `kernel_joints`. The kind is one lowercase word per node type, declared in ONE table, `NODE_KINDS` in `src/domain/graph/node-kinds.ts` (`pointKernel` is `kernel`, `movieFileIn` is `movie`); then one underscore; then the role, which holds letters, digits and underscores only. A new node is auto-named kind plus a number (`blur1`), which already conforms. Full rule, the table and the phase 2 plan: `docs/node-naming-2026-10-05.md`.

- `conformsToKind(name, kind)` is the one answer to whether a name conforms. Do not write a second regex.
- A component instance is named for its COMPONENT: an instance of Bloom is `bloom1`, then `bloom_glow`. Its kind is the component's own name, lowercased, letters only, and it is not in the type string (a component's id is minted), so ask `kindOf(definition)`; `kindOfType(type)` refuses an instance type. A new instance is auto-named (from the library, an import or an `addNode`; the one a saved selection becomes follows with the phase 2 sweep, because it changes the shipped starter component files). Renaming a component renames no node.
- In a document source, `named(role, type, …)` (`src/examples/documents/builders.ts`) writes the name from the role alone, and `namedInstance(role, componentName, type, …)` does it for a component instance. New examples, projects, tests and fixtures use `kind_role`.
- A new node type needs a row in `NODE_KINDS`; sharing a kind with another type needs an entry in `KIND_FAMILIES`.
- `node.rename` puts the kind in front of a name that lacks it and says so; `exact: true` stores a name as given. A `label` inside a patch (`addNode`, `setNodeLabel`) is always stored exactly: write it in full. The agent tool `apply_graph_patch` stores it and WARNS when it lacks its kind (`data.unconformingLabels` gives the conforming form).
- Stored names never move. Changing a kind renames nothing in any document.
- `src/examples/node-names.test.ts` (on `test:gates`) fails a shipped node whose name lacks its kind. Files written before the rule are in its `NOT_YET_RENAMED` ledger with the exact count each still owes; the count must match, so it can only go down. A component's In and Out are exempt: their name is the socket's label.
- A surface with room for one word (a Panel board, the Layers list, the phone) captions a Presets bank, a Layer, a Cue List and an untitled Panel by the ROLE of the name: `presets_looks` reads `looks`. Use `surfaceNameOf(node, catalogue)` (`src/nodes/definitions/controls.ts`); it is a caption, never an address, and a name that does not carry its kind is shown whole.
- Below 70 % zoom every node carries a label, its kind and then the rest of its name, that does not shrink with the canvas (T1597b, `src/editor/nodes/kind-label.ts`). The canvas writes the zoom on each label element; never put it on an ancestor of the nodes as an inherited custom property (measured: twelve times the cost).

## Testing bar (enforced in review)

- Assert values the consumer reads back, not mechanisms ("which buffer was bound" is mechanism).
- For any driven parameter or wire, assert what differs if the edge were cut, ideally a render diff.
- Write bug repros as the literal bug through the real stack (compiler + backend + Dawn), not as a unit test of the fix.
- Guards go against the cause, not the observable, and the test must exercise the legitimate case the guard could swallow.
- Verify a gate can fail before trusting it green (red-verify by editing, restore by editing).
- Comments that predict future work carry their task id; landing the work deletes or past-tenses the comment.
