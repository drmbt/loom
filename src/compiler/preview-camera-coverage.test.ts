/**
 * T1655b — A 3D NODE TYPE CANNOT LAND WITHOUT A CAMERA CONTROL OR A REASON.
 *
 * The owner asked twice: "certain nodes are missing a way to control their freeview camera.
 * like the camera node and some other stuff that actually handles geometry". T675 answered
 * the first time with a table by PAYLOAD KIND, which is complete for kinds and says nothing
 * about node TYPES: a camera with one Render borrows a row that has no kind on it, a Render
 * is a picture and not a payload, and a geometry that draws only its backdrop carried an
 * orbit that moved nothing. Each was a type the table could not see.
 *
 * So this walks the REGISTRY. Every node type that outputs something 3D, or draws a picture
 * of something 3D, is compiled in the smallest document that makes it draw, with a preview
 * sink on it, and its row must carry one of the three answers (`ResolvedOutput.previewCamera`):
 *
 *  - `orbit`, with a basis that names a pass the tile really draws and that takes a matrix;
 *  - `pose`, on a node that declares the Eye and Look At the gesture writes;
 *  - `none`, with a sentence.
 *
 * What makes it a gate and not a list (§V461): the subjects are DERIVED from port kinds, and
 * every port kind in the registry must be classified below as 3D or not, so a new node type
 * is a subject the day it is registered and a new port kind is a failure until someone says
 * which side it is on. A type that needs more than a default input to draw needs a recipe
 * here, and has none by default: it fails until one is written.
 *
 * The other half is `src/tests/e2e/preview-camera.spec.ts`, which drives the real gestures
 * on the real GPU: this file proves the compiler SAYS it, that one that the app DOES it.
