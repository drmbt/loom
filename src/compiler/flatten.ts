/**
 * Component flattening (T134, T135, §V82, §V83).
 *
 * A component does not compile as a node. It is INLINED into the parent logical graph
 * before anything else in the compiler runs, so the plan the backend receives has no idea
 * components exist — pruning, ordering, resolution propagation and resource assignment
 * all keep working on one flat graph, unchanged (§V25, §V21, §V6).
 *
 * Two things have to survive that inlining, and they are the whole of this module:
 *
 *  - the VALUES. An internal parameter driven by a published knob takes the instance's
 *    value, not the value stored in the definition's graph (§V80); a `parent.<key>`
 *    binding takes the value from the owning instance, walked lexically (§V81). Both are
 *    resolved here, at compile time (§V21), and baked onto the flattened node — so the
 *    rest of the compiler reads one ordinary `GraphNode` and cannot get it wrong.
 *
 *    T1017 qualifies "baked": a published knob whose mode can MOVE per frame is handed
 *    down as its own unresolved SLOT rather than a number, so the internal parameter it
 *    drives animates through the per-frame values-only resolution (§V163) while this
 *    walk stays a pure function of the document and keeps its memo (§V529). Still one
 *    ordinary `GraphNode`: a slot is what a parameter written by hand holds too. See
 *    `publishedPage`.
 *
 *  - the SOURCE PATH. Every flattened node keeps `Main / DreamyFeedback_2 / Blur_1`, so a
 *    diagnostic, a timing row or a profile entry names a place the user can navigate to
 *    rather than an internal node id they have never seen (§V82).
 *
 * ## Id namespacing
 *
 * A flattened internal node is named `<instance node id>/<internal node id>`, applied once
 * per level of nesting: `feedback1/blur2/inner3`. That makes two instances of the same
 * component disjoint (`feedback1/blur` vs `feedback2/blur`), keeps root node ids untouched
 * so an existing plan's resource ids do not move, and stays reversible — splitting on "/"
 * gives back the instance chain, which is how `sources` is built. Node ids may not contain
 * "/"; `internalParameterPath` in the components track already relies on the same rule.

/**
 * Is flattening this document the IDENTITY? (T1176)
 *
 * ## Why the question is worth asking
 *
 * `flattenComponents` runs on every document revision — every knob turn, every commit —
 * and the overwhelming majority of documents contain no component instance at all. For
 * those, the whole walk below is an elaborate way of producing the graph it was given:
 * every node comes back as `{ ...node, id: node.id, parameters: { ...node.parameters } }`
 * and every edge as a field-for-field copy of itself. The costly part is not the copying
 * — it is `effectiveParameterSchema`, which REFLECTS a `customWgsl` node's schema out of
 * its WGSL source, and which the walk computes for every node whether or not anything
 * needs it. (It is read in exactly one place: the `parent.<key>` driver loop in
 * `effectiveParameters`. With no drivers, nothing reads it.)
 *
 * ## The four things that make the walk NOT the identity
 *
 * All four are checked, and any of them sends the document down the full walk:
 *
 *  1. a COMPONENT INSTANCE — the whole point of the walk;
 *  2. `state.parentBindings` on a node — at the root there is no parent scope, so
 *     `parentScopeDrivers` reports `component.parentScope.notFound` and the diagnostic
 *     is the answer. Legal to author (a node cut out of a component and pasted into the
 *     root graph has one), and silently dropping the diagnostic would leave a parameter
 *     reading a value that no longer exists with nothing said;
 *  3. a `bind`-mode slot whose ref starts `parent.` — the same case through §V107's
 *     slot, where the walk warns and falls back to §V108's retained static.
 *  4. a `parent()` read in an expression (VN36) — the same case again, through the grammar,
 *     and the same answer: `compiler/parent-reference-no-parent` and the retained static.
 *
 * §V83's recursion detector is skipped with them, and provably: it walks the document's
 * component references, and a document with no instance has none.
 *
 * The scan is a reference walk over `node.parameters`, so it costs a fraction of the one
 * reflection it saves.
