/**
 * A NODE'S NAME CARRIES ITS KIND: `kind_role` (T1593b, owner's ruling 2026-10-05).
 *
 * `slider_lamp`, `light_lamp`, `blur_diffuse`, `lfo_pathx`. The kind is a prefix, the way
 * TouchDesigner practice names operators (`null_out`, `constant_color`), so a node says what
 * it is on the canvas at any zoom and inside every `op('…')` that reads it. A new node is
 * auto-named `kind` + number (`blur1`, `kernel1`, §V129), which already conforms; a rename
 * keeps the prefix and the person types the role.
 *
 * ## The three conforming forms
 *
 *     kind            blur
 *     kind<digits>    blur1, blur12        (what auto-naming mints)
 *     kind_<role>     blur_diffuse, lfo_path_x, geometry_car01
 *
 * A KIND is lowercase ASCII letters only: no digit and no underscore. That is what makes
 * the name parse one way: the kind is everything before the first underscore, or before
 * the trailing digits. A ROLE is letters, digits and underscores, starting with a letter or
 * a digit. Nothing else: a space, a comma, a dot or a colon in a name breaks one of the
 * reference forms that hold names (a name list splits on spaces and commas, a preset target
 * is `name.key`, a legacy channel is `name:channel`), and TouchDesigner allows the same
 * three classes for the same reason. Letters and digits are Unicode, not only ASCII:
 * nothing in the reference grammar needs ASCII.
 *
 * ## ONE TABLE, and why the kind is not a field on each definition
 *
 * The kinds are one shared namespace, like TouchDesigner's operator type names. Whether
 * two types may share a word is a property of the SET, and it can only be reviewed as a
 * list. The functions that use a kind (`conformsToKind`, auto-naming, the rename rule, the
 * shipped-name gate, the example builders, the phase 2 sweep) are pure functions of
 * `(name, type)` and run where no registry is in hand. So the table lives here, in the
 * domain, beside the naming rule, exactly as `SOURCE_REFERENCE_PARAMETERS` does. It is
 * TOTAL: every registered type has a row, and `src/examples/node-names.test.ts` (on
 * `pnpm test:gates`) fails by name when a new type lands without one.
 *
 * A type the table does not hold (a test fixture, a definition registered at runtime)
 * falls back to today's base, `nameBaseFor(type)`.
 *
 * ## STORED NAMES NEVER MOVE
 *
 * A kind is read when a name is MINTED or CHECKED, never when a document is loaded.
 * Changing a row changes what the next new node is called and what the gate asks of
 * shipped documents; it rewrites nothing. A node named `pointkernel1` yesterday is still
 * `pointkernel1` today, and every reference to it still resolves.
 *
 * ## How each kind was chosen
 *
 * 1. The type, lowercased, when that is one word: `blur`, `noise`, `feedback`.
 * 2. A leading FAMILY word is dropped. `point…`, `value…`, `custom…`, `component…` and
 *    `render…` say which shelf the node is on, and the node's body wash and port colours
 *    already say that; the kind names the operation. `pointKernel` → `kernel`,
 *    `valueMath` → `math`, `customWgsl` → `wgsl`, `renderInstances` → `instances`.
 * 3. A file input is named for its medium: `movieFileIn` → `movie`, `meshFileIn` → `mesh`.
 * 4. A compound stays whole when no single word says it: `cornerpin`, `camerablur`.
 *
 * The word is the one the library shows as the node's title wherever that is possible, so
 * a kind can be looked up by typing it.
 */

/**
 * ## A COMPONENT INSTANCE IS NAMED FOR ITS COMPONENT (ruled 2026-10-05, phase 1b)
 *
 * An instance of Bloom is `bloom1`, then `bloom_glow`. Its kind is THE COMPONENT'S OWN
 * NAME, lowercased to the kind character set (`kindFromName`): to a reader an instance of
 * Bloom is "a bloom", exactly as a Blur is "a blur". It is not `comp`: that would say only
 * that the node is a component, which the stacked card on the canvas already says.
 *
 * So an instance's kind is NOT a function of its type string. The type carries the
 * component's id (`component:cmp_7@2`), and an id is opaque: a saved component's id is
 * minted, not spelled from its name. The name lives on the component's definition, which
 * the registry hands out as the instance's `title`. `kindOf` takes that pair; `kindOfType`
 * refuses an instance type by name rather than answer with a word that is wrong.
 *
 * Two consequences, both deliberate:
 *
 *  - A component MAY share a word with a built-in kind. One called "Blur" makes instances
 *    of kind `blur`, numbered in the same sequence as Blur nodes (`blur1`, `blur2`), so
 *    names stay unique. To the reader it is that kind of thing, and conformance is a
 *    question about a name and a kind, never about which type holds the kind.
 *  - RENAMING A COMPONENT RENAMES NO NODE. A kind is read when a name is minted or
 *    checked, so instances made under the old name keep it and every reference to them
 *    still resolves. They simply stop carrying the (new) kind: the canvas shows their type
 *    again, and the title editor offers the new kind the next time one is renamed.
