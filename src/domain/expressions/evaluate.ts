 * ## What the grammar is FOR
 *
 * An expression is a value written WHERE IT IS READ: no node, no wire, no channel. That
 * is locality, and locality was already worth having with arithmetic alone. What
 * arithmetic alone could not do was say anything PERIODIC or BOUNDED, which is most of
 * what a parameter on a moving image wants to say — so `time * 7` on a ±360 rotate was
 * the only ramp available, and it hits the manifest's limit and stops (T368). Every name
 * below earns its place by one of two tests:
 *
 *  - the arithmetic grammar CANNOT express it (`sin`, `cos`, `min`, `max`, `floor`,
 *    `ceil`, `round`, `sign` — no series here; comparisons joined the GRAMMAR in T628;
 *    `atan2` joined in T1420b: there is no inverse trig to build it from, and it is the
 *    angle of a position, finite for every input); or
 *  - it is the CORRECT form of something the arithmetic form gets subtly wrong
 *    (`clamp` is what a bounded parameter does to you silently, said out loud; `mod` is a
 *    true modulo where `%` is a remainder that goes negative below zero; `fract` is the
 *    0..1 phase `x % 1` only appears to be; T1420b: `exp` is the `e ^ x` a typed-in
 *    `2.718 ^ x` only approximates, and `smoothstep` is the eased ramp whose arithmetic
 *    form repeats one clamped term, `t ^ 2 * (3 - 2 * t)`, where a typo in either copy
 *    still evaluates — the On Nothing shots (§T1400b) spelled it out in two helpers).
 *
 * Names that fail both tests stay out, and the rejection message lists what is in, so
 * typing one teaches the boundary instead of just failing. `sqrt` is `x ^ 0.5`; `mix` is
 * `a + (b - a) * t`; `hypot` and `pow` are the same story. `tan`, `log`, `asin` and
 * friends are excluded for a second reason as well: each has inputs where it returns a
 * non-finite number, and this evaluator's contract is a finite one — `exp` is let in
 * because its one such input, an overflow above ~709, is refused by name.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * This runs on the CPU for every expression-mode parameter, every frame (§V163). A call
 * costs one `Map`-free object lookup plus the `Math` builtin; ARITY is checked when the
 * source is PARSED, so the per-frame path never re-validates a shape that cannot have
 * changed. Parse once, evaluate per frame, exactly as before.

 * ORDINARY CONTROL FLOW on the app's hottest path, not an exception: §V108 says an

 * *expected* to produce one of these per unresolvable expression per compile. The
 * frameless STRUCTURAL compile — the one a knob turn runs, sixty times a second — has no
 * `time` and no `frame` in scope, so every clock-reading expression in the document fails
 * by design on every commit.
 *
 * Constructing an `Error` captures a stack trace, and capturing one per expression per
 * compile cost 21.2% OF E55'S ENTIRE COMPILE — measured without editing anything, by
 * flipping `Error.stackTraceLimit` between 10 and 0 in alternating rounds of the same
 * process (E13 1.4%, E33 12.3%, E55 21.2%: the effect scales with how many expressions
 * the document holds, which is what makes it the stack and not the block's noise), and
 * the `stackTraceLimit` lever buys 0% once this class stops extending `Error` — which is
 * how the fix is known to be the same fix. Nothing ever reads the stack:
 * both catch sites below convert this into `{ ok: false, reason }` immediately, and it
 * cannot escape the module — `fail` is called only from the parser and the evaluator, and

 * THE PARSE MEMO (T1172) — KEYED BY THE SOURCE TEXT, SO IT CANNOT OUTLIVE AN EDIT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `evaluateAst` exists because "parse once, evaluate per frame" is the right shape, and
 * the docblock below it has said so since T202. Nothing on the per-frame path ever did
 * it: `resolveStored` calls `evaluateExpression`, which parses first, so every expression
 * in an animated document was re-tokenised and re-parsed sixty times a second — and
 * §T1172 measured PARSE AT 82% OF THE COST OF EVALUATING ONE. This is that docblock's
 * promise, kept where every caller gets it instead of at one call site that remembers to.
 *
 * ⚠ The key is the trimmed source text and nothing else. An expression's AST is a pure
 * function of the characters it was written with, so an edit is a different key and a hit
 * can only ever be the parse of the very text asked about — there is no invalidation to
 * forget. The FAILURE is cached too, and deliberately: a document holding a typo re-parses
 * it every frame exactly like a working one, and the reason string is as pure a function
 * of the input as the tree is.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS MAKES THE AST SHARED, AND IT IS ALREADY TREATED AS IMMUTABLE. `evaluateNode`
 * reads it; `parameter-dependencies.ts` walks it; `reference.ts`, `validate.ts`,
 * `expression-range.ts` and `parameter-mode.tsx` inspect it. Nothing writes to a node, and
 * nothing may start — a mutation would now reach every later reader of the same text.
 *
 * FIFO past a cap, for the same reason the reflection memo (T1172) is: the working set is
 * the distinct expressions in one document, and the only way past the cap is somebody
 * TYPING one, where every keystroke mints a new key and the oldest entry is the coldest.
