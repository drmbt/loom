/**
 * Graph-backed driven channels (T238-T240, §V143).
 *
 * The bridge between value-source NODES (LFO, Constant, Timer — anything declaring
 * `valueChannel`) and the parameter resolver's `driven` mode (T203): a parameter driven
 * by channel `lfo1` reads the value-source node NAMED `lfo1` (§V129 — names are
 * identifiers, which is what makes this addressing possible at all). Plug the result
 * into `ResolveParametersOptions.channels` and the reserved mode comes alive.
 *
 * Determinism (§V143, §V44, §V45): the value is a pure function of the source node's
 * parameter values and the frame — no wall clock anywhere — so offline render and live
 * playback agree frame for frame, and the same project at the same frame index is the
 * same picture on every machine.
 *
 * The SOURCE node's own parameters resolve as their static view here, deliberately: an
 * LFO whose frequency is itself driven would recurse through this resolver, and a
 * channel graph is exactly the kind of loop §V110 exists to prevent. Modulating an
 * LFO's frequency is real (TD does it) and arrives with channel-graph cycle detection,
 * not by accident.
 *
 * T1524b: `morphs` is the preset morphs in flight over this same graph
 * (`FlattenedGraph.morphs`). A source parameter a bank is still fading stores its
 * DESTINATION, so the static view alone would publish the end value while the value graph
 * in front of this backstop — and the picture — are half-way there. The fading keys are
 * therefore read through the resolver's own fold, over that same static view.

   * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   * THE NAME INDEX, BUILT ONCE PER RESOLVER (T1245)
   * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   *
   * `nodeByName` calls `nodeNames`, which SORTS EVERY NODE ID AND BUILDS A FRESH `Map` —
   * and it was called once per `op('x').chan` read, which is once per driven parameter
   * per frame. §T1182's fast-path profile measured `nodeNames` at 13.7% of a 3000-frame
   * run, the largest self cost left in it. The index is a pure function of `graph`, so
   * building it once and asking it N times is the same N answers for a fraction of the
   * work. §T1172 did exactly this for the PARAMETER reader (`node-references.ts`); the
   * channel resolver was the other half of the same call and did not get it.
   *
   * ⚠ WHY THE SCOPE IS THIS CLOSURE, AND WHY THAT CANNOT GO STALE. `graph` is captured
   * ONCE, at construction, and this closure never reads any other document — so "the
   * graph this index describes" and "the graph this resolver answers about" are the same
   * object by construction, and there is no window between them for an edit to land in.
   * Every document that reaches here is a settled one: the store hands out a NEW frozen
   * object per revision (`setAutoFreeze(true)` in `store.ts`), and `flattenComponents`
   * returns a new one per (revision, catalogue revision). So a rename, an add, a delete
   * or a component re-flatten produces a new graph object, `use-graph-compile.ts`'s
   * `channels` memo — keyed on `flatGraph` — builds a NEW resolver over it, and that
   * resolver builds its own index on its first read. Nothing is invalidated because
   * nothing outlives the thing it describes.
   *
   * This is also why the index is NOT in `names.ts` and NOT keyed on graph identity in a
   * module-level map: `apply-patch.ts` calls `nodeNames` on an immer DRAFT it is still
   * mutating (two `addNode` ops in one patch, and the second `uniqueNodeName` must see
   * the first add), so a memo keyed on the object would hand it a pre-mutation index and
   * mint a duplicate name (§V127). `names.test.ts` gates that. No channel resolver is
   * ever built over a draft — `context.channels` comes down the bus from this one memo.
   *
   * `nodeNames` itself is the index, unchanged, so the two answers it has always given
   * are preserved exactly: on a DUPLICATE label the node whose id sorts first wins
   * (`Object.keys(...).sort()`, first-wins), and a name matching nothing is `undefined`,
   * which the caller reads as "not my channel".
