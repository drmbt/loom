/**
 * T1508b (§T1398b second ruling B) — TIMELINE-PLACED CUES THAT AN EXPORT REPRODUCES: a cue
 * list whose `follow` is `timeline` is a PURE FUNCTION OF THE PLAYHEAD. The design is
 * `docs/presets-followups-design-2026-10-03.md` Part 2; the owner's three rulings are its
 * owner questions, answered "yes" (SPEC §T1508b).
 *
 * ## Values apply as drivers, never as writes
 *
 * A timed cue writes NOTHING. Each cue's end is what its recall WOULD write — the one
 * planner's `after` map (`presetRecallEnd`), so shots expand and ruling 4's skips apply
 * exactly as at GO — computed once per revision, and the resolver folds those ends over the
 * stored slot on `timeSeconds`, inside `buildMorphIndex` (`withTimelineCues`). One index, so
 * the compile, the flattening and the Dawn harness read the same thing (§B8's shape), and an
 * export — which steps the timeline from frame 0 — renders what playback showed. The
 * document's revision is the same after an export as before it.
 *
 * ## The fold on one key (the design doc §2.2 Q2)
 *
 * The cues of every following list that cover the key, in `at` order (ties: list name,
 * then position). Before the first is reached, the key is not the timeline's at all — the
 * stored slot, or a live recall's fade, shows. From the first one on, the timeline OUTRANKS
 * the stored slot and any live morph (owner ruling 1: a fader, a GO or the phone moving a
 * covered key writes the document but does not show until the list is back to live): start
 * from the newest cue that has FINISHED (or the stored slot when none has), and blend each
 * later reached cue in, `V = lerp(V, resolve(to_i), ease_i((t − at_i) / seconds_i))`. A
 * later cue arriving mid-fade therefore continues from what is on screen. Both ends resolve
 * live, so an expression end keeps moving. A key with no in-between (an enum, a string, a
 * boolean) cuts at its cue.
 *
 * Whether a cue is REACHED is a frame index against a per-revision integer (`cueReachFrame`),
 * never `n / fps >= at` as floats. Progress is still `(timeSeconds − at) / seconds`.
 *
 * ## Structural settings switch at the crossings (§T1537b; owner ruling 2's follow-up)
 *
 * A Layer's on/off and a key the compiler reads as structure (`compileTime`, a
 * resolution-policy input, a source reference such as a Layer's `picture`) cannot be a
 * driver: the plan itself differs. So a timed cue CUTS them at its frame, and what changes is
 * the GRAPH THAT IS COMPILED — the document with the timeline's structural overrides at the
 * playhead applied (`buildTimelineStructure` → `applyTimelineStructure`), never a write. The
 * overrides are piecewise constant between crossings, so each segment is one plan: the live
 * loop recompiles at a crossing (ahead of it, warmed, §T1507b), an export swaps plans on the
 * crossing frame, and both read the same function of the playhead.
 *
 * A structural key on a component INSTANCE (§T1544b) reaches the compile only through the
 * instance's published fan-out, so the override follows it: an instance key is structural
 * when a parameter it is published onto is (`publishedReachesStructure`, judged by the
 * definition), and the structure overrides those parameters inside the flat graph
 * (`publishedTargets`, the flattening's own origins), each cut in the form flattening
 * writes there. Still SKIPPED with the named warning (`cue.timeline.structural`): an
 * instance whose definition cannot be read (no catalogue, or not installed) while its own
 * page calls the key structural — there is no fan-out to follow.
 *
 * ## A timed list is all-timed (owner ruling 3)
 *
 * GO, BACK and fire are refused on a following list (`cue.timeline`, `cue-commands.ts`); a
 * cue with no `at` is skipped with a warning; manual cues run from a second, live list.
