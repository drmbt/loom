/**
 * T1496b (§T1398b S1) — `preset.store` and `preset.recall`: a bank's Store captures its
 * declared targets as whole slots, and its Recall writes them back as ONE patch.
 *
 * ## One recall is one patch (the design doc §4.4)
 *
 * Every target, and the bank's own `current`, go into ONE `GraphPatch` applied through
 * `applyGraphPatch` — so the recall is one revision, one undo group and one audit entry
 * under the name `preset.recall` and the invoking actor, and one undo puts every target
 * back. Per-node writes would be N undo steps and a half-recalled look after the first
 * undo. `splitUndo` keeps it its own group even inside a caller's transaction: a Panel
 * gesture's coalescing must not swallow a recall into a slider drag.
 *
 * ## Skip what is gone, refuse only when nothing is left (ruling 4)
 *
 * A bank outlives its targets: a node gets deleted, a component's page loses a key, a
 * hand-edited value stops fitting. Each such entry is SKIPPED with a warning that names
 * it (`glow`, `glow.radius`), and the rest applies. Only a recall that would change no
 * target at all is refused — "recalled" with nothing moved would be a lie in the audit
 * log. Validation is the same one `setParameters` runs (the node's EFFECTIVE schema, so a
 * component instance's published page and a customWgsl's reflected controls count, §T903),
 * checked per key BEFORE the patch is built, so one bad value cannot abort the others.
 *
 * ## The whole slot (ruling 2)
 *
 * A preset holds a key's STORED form: a bare value, or the whole slot with its mode and
 * every retained binding, so an expression comes back as that expression. A bare value
 * written over a slot would, through `setParameters`, only update the slot's retained
 * static (§B166) and leave an expression in effect — so a recall writes it as a
 * static-mode slot instead, keeping the slot's other bindings (§V108: never destructive).
 *
 * ## A morph commits the END state, and a record beside it (T1497b, the design doc §5)
 *
 * A recall with a non-zero morph writes exactly the values a cut writes — the document
 * holds the destination from that moment, so the inspector, Store, a save, the phone and
 * undo all see it — plus ONE record in the bank's `morphs` parameter, in the SAME patch:
 * where each changed key came from, the absolute clock's reading at the recall, the
 * duration and the curve. The fade is the resolver's business (`resolve.ts`, through
 * `morph-index.ts`), a pure function of the document and the frame; nothing here runs per
 * frame, and one undo takes the record away together with the values, so the screen cuts
 * back. Which morph applies is §5.1's precedence: the recall's own `morph`, else the
 * preset's, else the bank's `morph` / `curve` parameters.
 *
 * The handler reads NO clock (§V44). `context.frameClock` is the last frame the app's
 * transport produced, attached to the bus the way the channel resolver is; a bus with no
 * app has none, and a morph asked for there commits as a cut and says so
 * (`preset.recall.morphUnavailable`) — the values land either way.
 *
 * ## A shot: other banks' presets, in the same patch (T1499b, the design doc §8.1)
 *
 * A preset's `recalls` name other banks' presets. The planner EXPANDS them depth-first
 * and lays every preset's values into one map before it resolves a single name, so a shot
 * is still one patch — one revision, one undo, one audit entry — however many banks it
 * reaches, and its morph is still ONE record, in the recalled bank, over every key the
 * shot changed. What is laid later wins: a preset's recalls in the order written, then
 * the preset's OWN values over all of them (ruling 14). The same holds at every level, so
 * the shot itself always has the last word. A nested preset's own `morph` is not read:
 * the shot is the recall, and §5.1's ladder is about the recall.
 *
 * A CYCLE is refused, naming the banks on it, and so is a nesting deeper than
 * `MAX_RECALL_DEPTH`: both are mistakes in the bank's text, not targets that went away,
 * so nothing is written rather than a guess at where to stop. A recall that names a bank
 * or a preset that is NOT THERE is ruling 4's case instead — skipped with a warning that
 * names it, and the rest applies.
 *
 * Each nested bank a preset actually wrote something from gets its `current` in the same
 * patch: `current` is "the last preset recalled", and a Panel beside the shots bank would
 * otherwise go on highlighting the look the shot just replaced.
 *
 * ## Layer on/off (T1498b's seam, the design doc §4.4 step 5 and §7.2)
 *
 * A preset's `on` map is written as `setNodeUi { bypassed: !on }` on each named Layer, in
 * the same patch, so a layer's on/off is undone with the rest of the recall. Always a cut
 * — it is structural. Only a Layer: the doc's `on` is "layer on/off", and bypassing an
 * arbitrary node from a bank is not something it rules in.
 *
 * ## The seam the cue list uses
 *
 * `planPresetRecall` is THE recall planner: the cue list's GO (§T1500b) runs it with the
 * cue's morph and adds its own `current`/`standby` to the same patch.
