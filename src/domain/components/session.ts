/**
 * Editing the inside of a component (T130).
 *
 * A component's internal network is a `GraphDocument`, and the thing that edits a
 * `GraphDocument` correctly already exists: a `GraphStore` behind a command bus. So
 * entering a component opens one of those over the definition's internal graph, and every
 * command the editor already has — add node, connect, set parameters, undo, redo, the
 * audit log — works inside a component with no second implementation and no second set of
 * invariants to keep in step (§V29, §V32, §V34).
 *
 * That is also what makes §V80 real rather than aspirational: turning a published knob
 * inside a component is `graph.applyPatch` with N `setParameters` operations, which the
 * store already guarantees is atomic and one undo group.
 *
 * Every committed change is written back into the catalogue, so a fix reaches every
 * linked instance immediately (§V79). Nesting needs nothing extra: a component inside a
 * component is entered by opening a session on it in turn.
 *
 * ## A write from OUTSIDE the session (§T1540b)
 *
 * The catalogue has other writers: a Store or Delete on a look instance writes its page
 * bank into this definition from the root bus, `preset.moveIntoComponent` adds a bank, an
 * import replaces the definition. The session's store still holds the graph it last
 * wrote, so its next commit — even an unrelated rename, even an undo — would register
 * that stale graph and silently drop the outside write.
 *
 * The session therefore tracks the graph it last synced with the catalogue. When the
 * catalogue's graph moves away from it, the session is STALE: it says so once through
 * `onStale` (`component.session.stale`), and from then on it refuses to write back — the
 * same refusal, by name. It does not merge in place: a `GraphStore` cannot adopt a graph
 * (no `replaceGraph`, and an `addNode` patch cannot reproduce the outside write's ids),
 * and its undo history holds entity states from before the write, so undoing across it
 * would drop the write too. The holder reopens a session over the new definition instead
 * (`use-component-editing.ts`) — the rebase. Nothing is lost there: every valid session
 * edit has already been committed by the time anything else can write, so the session
 * holds nothing the new definition lacks; what restarts is its undo history.
 *
 * ## Undo restores the definition too (§T1545b)
 *
 * The session's store holds the GRAPH; the rest of the definition — exposed ports, the
 * published page and its targets — lives only in the catalogue, and a graph step can change
 * it: the write-back prune drops a target or an exposure whose node is gone, and an
 * in-session `component.detach` moves the outer page's targets and exposures onto the
 * copies. Undoing the graph step alone brought the node back with its targets and exposures
 * still gone (a detach undone left the page aimed at copies that no longer exist, and the
 * prune then dropped them). So the session records, per undo step, the definition before and
 * after it — `before` when the step is pushed, `after` once it is written back and again
 * when the command that made it re-registers the definition in the same step
 * (`onDefinitionStep`) — and an undo or redo of that step puts the recorded side back,
 * field by field, for every field that still holds what the step left.
 *
 * A definition-only command (publish, unpublish, expose, unexpose, reorder) changes no
 * graph, so it makes its step with `context.applyStep` (§T1546b) — a revision, an audit
 * entry and a slot in the actor's history with no entity in it — and registers the edited
 * definition inside that step, which pairs before/after with it through `onDefinitionStep`
 * the same way. Undo and redo of that step move no graph entity; the revision bump is the
 * commit this listener reads, and the recorded side is put back like any other.
