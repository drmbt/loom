/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * T1172 — THE TARGET MEMO: THE ONE THAT CHANGES THE COMPLEXITY CLASS
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A read is a RESOLVE of the target's WHOLE parameter set, recursively through the
 * target's own expressions — right semantics, paid once per read. §T1172 measured a chain
 * of references as quadratic: 20 chained refs 0.9 ms/frame, 40 chained 4.2, 80 chained
 * 25.3, 160 chained 171.6, with render cost held at zero on the mock backend. Memoised per
 * READER it is linear: 0.40, 0.71, 1.40, 3.11 — a 55x cut at 160, and E55 4.7x faster
 * end to end.
 *
 * ⚠ TWO WAYS THIS COULD BE A BUG AND BOTH ARE GATED HERE.
 *
 * (1) A MEMO THAT OUTLIVES THE FRAME. Then every reference freezes on the number it had
 *     when the memo was minted, and the picture stops while every static assertion stays
 *     green — §B181 exactly, whose 26 tests were all green for months because every one
 *     of them resolved a STATIC. So the gates below drive references from the frame clock
 *     and from a channel, and assert the value MOVES when its driver moves.
 *
 * (2) A MEMO SERVED ACROSS DIFFERENT `visited` CHAINS. `visited` is read in exactly one
 *     place — §V152's cycle guard — so a resolve during which the guard never fired is
 *     path-independent, and an entry is only stored when that holds. The cycle gates are
 *     what hold that line: a loop must still be NAMED, and a node reachable both through
 *     a cycle and cleanly must still answer correctly on the clean path.
