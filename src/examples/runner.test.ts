 * THE EXAMPLE GATE (T157, §V89).
 *
 * Every `.loom.json` in `examples/` must load through the real loader with no complaints,
 * compile to a plan the real backend reader accepts, and replay a fixed frame sequence
 * identically twice. §V89 makes a failure here a release blocker, and that is the whole
 * design: an example breaking means the FILE FORMAT regressed, a node manifest changed
 * incompatibly, or the compiler broke. None of those are "a docs chore".
 *
 * The suite is generated from `listExamples()`, which reads the directory. There is no
 * list of example names here on purpose — a gate you have to remember to register a file
 * with is a gate that eventually has a hole in it. Dropping a file into `examples/` is the
 * entire registration step. The one hard-coded list below is the OPPOSITE check: it fails
 * if a shipped example DISAPPEARS, which discovery alone could never notice.
