/**
 * §T1641b — NO SHIPPED DOCUMENT HOLDS SOMETHING THAT CAN NEVER TAKE EFFECT.
 *
 * §B262 shipped in a project file: three lamps whose expression called a function the
 * grammar does not have, each rendering at its stored value. The compile said so, as a
 * warning nobody read, and no gate read `projects/` at all. This one reads every shipped
 * document (the examples, the starter component files, every project document) through
 * the real load, with the file's own component library, and holds it to three things.
 *
 *  1. AT REST, what a save by code would refuse (`refusedAtCodeSave` over
 *     `documentFindings`): anything whose CLASS is `never`, at any severity; a code nobody
 *     has classed; an error on a node a sink reaches. By class and not by code, so a code
 *     that is split tomorrow cannot walk past it. `documentFindings` is the write gate
 *     asked of every stored node, in the document's own graph and in every definition the
 *     file carries, with the structural compile's report: so this reads what only the
 *     write gate checks (a payload a slot KEEPS, of another type than its parameter; a
 *     pulse stored armed), which no compile ever saw.
 *  2. AT A FRAME. Three frames of each (0, 1 and 30, at 60 a second) through the real value
 *     graph, then every node's parameters resolved at that frame with its channels. No
 *     GPU, no plan: about a third of a second for the set. Nothing of class `never` may
 *     appear, and what is still WAITING at a frame is the ledger below, exactly.
 *  3. THE DOOR. Every module under `src/examples` and `src/projects` that writes a document
 *     writes it through the checked save (`checked-project.ts`).
 *
 * What it cannot read: a finding only an asset's contents show (a mesh's joints), anything
 * a device decides, and a frame's own node compiles (it resolves parameters at a frame and
 * builds no pass).
 *
 * It lives beside the documents because it reads the document set, and is on `test:gates`
 * for the same reason: no file's own tests would run it.
