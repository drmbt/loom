/**
 * T1314b / §B219 — WHAT THE CAMERA GIZMO IS ALLOWED TO MOVE, read from the RESOLVED
 * document rather than the stored one.
 *
 * ## The corruption this exists to end
 *
 * §T692's gizmo guarded on the BARE `eye` key: present and a plain 3-array meant "static,
 * go ahead". But §V113 makes a compound COMPONENT-ADDRESSABLE — a driven channel stores
 * its own slot under `eye.x`, and the bare key supplies only the base tuple — so the guard
 * never saw the one thing that decides whether a channel may be written. Measured on the
 * shipped catalogue: 12 of 20 camera nodes armed the gizmo while a channel was driven, and
 * FOUR (E25 ×2, E28, E69) store no bare `eye` at all, so the read fell through to a
 * hardcoded copy of the schema default `[0, 0.5, 3]` — E69 Burnish's camera actually sits
 * near `[·, 1.9, 8.4]`.
 *
 * The write then landed on the INACTIVE static binding while `mode: "expression"` stayed in
 * place. Net effect, and it is the nastiest shape available: the drag lands, the camera does
 * not move, and §V914's retained value — what every thumbnail, headless render and claim
 * uses when nothing is driving — is replaced by an arbitrary dragged pose. Silent in the
 * app, visible only later in a render nobody connected to a drag.
 *
 * ## Why RESOLVED, and why that needs no new plumbing
 *
 * A driven channel's stored static is stale by construction: it is the retained value, not
 * where the camera is. Orbiting about a pivot derived from stale numbers would swing the
 * free channels through the wrong arc. So the pose is resolved — through the bus's read scope
 * (`bus.readScope()`: the channel resolver, the frame on screen, the flattening), which
 * `graph-pane` already holds. §T1557b: it used to be handed `{ channels }` alone, with no
 * cross-node reader, so an `op('k1').chan.value` channel read its static (§B181's shape).
 *
 * ## The rule, which is one control over and already written
 *
 * `label-drag.ts` solved this for the inspector's vector label: `movableMask` refuses to
 * write a driven channel's displayed value back, and says which channel is held and by
 * what. This module is that answer applied to the tile's gesture, so the two surfaces refuse
 * identically. (§T970: the SENTENCE is this module's own. It used to be the label's, "Drag
 * the name to move y and z together", which is about a gesture nobody makes on a tile, and
 * nothing read it.) Refusal is ABSENT rather than
 * disabled (§T1049) and total refusal comes only when EVERY channel is driven — there is
 * then nothing to fly. A partly driven camera still flies, on the channels that are free.
