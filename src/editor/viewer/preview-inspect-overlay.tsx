/**
 * T892 — THE CAMERA TOGGLE IS ON THE PICTURE, AND IT IS DRAWN ABOVE THE TILE.
 *
 * ## The owner asked three times; this is what made it hard
 *
 * "the camera toggle still sits in the header of nodes that support camera movement in
 * their preview. i asked to have that moved out of there and overlaid on the actual
 * preview canvas bottom right … so we can gain more space for the node title." The point
 * is the TITLE'S WIDTH: `C` is the fourth button in a `P B M C` row on a 178px node, and
 * the title was truncating to two characters plus an ellipsis to pay for it.
 *
 * It had been on the tile before, twice (T613, T664), and T675 moved it OFF for a real
 * reason that has not gone away: the shared preview surface (`app/panes.module.css
 * .previewSurface`) is a full-pane canvas at `--z-canvas-overlay` (30) and composites
 * each live tile at that node's slot rect, while everything inside a node is sealed
 * inside `.react-flow__viewport` — a transformed element at z-index 2, therefore a
 * stacking context no descendant can escape. A control rendered in the node's preview
 * slot is PAINTED OVER exactly when the tile is live, which is exactly when there is
 * something to inspect. `pointer-events: none` on the surface is why that bug was
 * invisible to every DOM test: the button still took clicks, it just could not be seen.
 *
 * So "put it back on the tile" is not a matter of moving JSX. The control has to be drawn
 * in a layer that is a SIBLING of the compositing surface rather than a descendant of the
 * viewport — which is this component: one pane-level layer at `--z-canvas-chrome` (31),
 * `pointer-events: none`, holding one button per orbitable tile, positioned by the same
 * arithmetic that places the tile itself.
 *
 * ## Positioned, never measured
 *
 * `slotScreenRect` is the function `use-node-previews.ts` uses to place the tile on the
 * surface, fed from the same two facts: the slot's offset within its node (published by
 * `NodePreviewSlot`, node-local so it survives a drag) and the node's LIVE position from
 * React Flow (§V112 — never `GraphNode.position`, which lags for the whole of a drag).
 * Using the tile's own placement function is what keeps the button on the corner of the
 * picture at every zoom and through every pan; a `getBoundingClientRect` per button per
 * frame is the forced-layout-during-pan mistake design note §2 warns about.
 *
 * The button SCALES with the zoom, because it is chrome on a node and every other piece
 * of node chrome does. At a zoom where the header's own toggles are unreadable this one
 * is too, and that is the honest behaviour — a control that stayed 14px while its node
 * shrank to a chip would end up bigger than the picture it sits on.
 *
 * ## Why the pointer problem solves itself
 *
 * The tile drags and orbits: a press inside `NodePreviewSlot` starts a camera gesture
 * (`onPointerDown` there). A button drawn INSIDE that box would start a drag on the way
 * to being clicked, which is the classic overlay bug. Here the button is not a descendant
 * of the slot at all — it is in a different subtree, outside React Flow entirely — so the
 * slot's handler never sees the press, and the graph pane below never sees it either
 * because d3-zoom listens on `.react-flow__pane`, which is not an ancestor. Structure,
 * not a `stopPropagation` that someone can delete.
 *
 * ## What survives from T675
 *
 * ABSENT, never disabled (T669): a node with nothing to inspect is offered no camera at
 * all — `inspect` returns null and no button is rendered. A suspended preview publishes
 * no orbit, so the control's absence reads as that state.
 *
 * ALWAYS VISIBLE, never hover-only (§T854's precedent): it is view state (§V255), so
 * revealing it on hover would be defensible — but hidden chrome is how this control was
 * lost twice already, and T854's `×` had to pair hidden with `pointer-events: none` to
 * avoid an invisible live hit target. One quiet, permanently drawn button is cheaper than
 * both problems.
 *
 * ONE BOX IN BOTH STATES (T664): a one-letter `C` in a fixed square, state carried by
 * tone through `aria-pressed`, so pressing it cannot reflow or move the control.

 * this control was lost twice before (T664, T675). Alt+drag needs no chrome, but a control
