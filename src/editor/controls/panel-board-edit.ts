/**
 * T1516b — WHAT AN EDIT GESTURE ON A PANEL BOARD WRITES, as pure functions: the board in,
 * the next stored board (or a refusal) out. The Controls tab's edit mode calls these and
 * sends the answer through the bus as ONE patch (`boardOperations`), so every move, resize,
 * label and column change is one undo step.
 *
 * Every answer is the WHOLE derived board written back (`storedBoardOf`): an item that was
 * still flowing gets pinned where it is drawn, so editing one control never makes another
 * jump, and an item whose widget was unwired leaves storage here.
 *
 * ## The no-overlap rule: REFUSE
 *
 * A move or resize whose rect would cover another item, leave the board's columns, or
 * shrink below the item's minimum is refused — `null`, nothing written, the control stays
 * where it was. Pushing the neighbours aside was the alternative; it can cascade down the
 * board and move things the owner did not touch, which on a performance surface is worse
 * than a drop that does not take. The drag shows the refusal before the drop does.
