 * T1512b — HOW A WIDGET JOINS A PANEL, as patch operations.

 * Membership is wiring (`panelLayout`, `controls.ts`), so every gesture that changes it is
 * an edge edit through the bus: dropping a widget node on a Panel and the widget's own "add
 * to panel" button both come here, and the answer is one patch — undoable as one step — or
 * nothing at all. Where a member SITS is the Panel's board (T1516b, `panel-board-edit.ts`),
 * which replaced the Controls tab's move-earlier/later buttons.
 *
 * T1501b — a Presets bank, a Layer and a Cue List join the same two ways, but BY NAME:
 * none of them has a value output to wire, so the patch is one board write that adds an
 * item naming the node (`boardWithMember`). A Panel laid out by its legacy Layout text has
 * no board, so it takes none of them.
