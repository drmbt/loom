/**
 * The metrics pipe (T41, T42, §V16).
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Per-frame numbers must reach the UI without touching the document store. Routing them
 * through the store would be wrong three times over: every metric tick would bump the
 * document revision (making undo history meaningless), every tick would re-render the
 * whole node tree, and a 60 Hz metric would end up serialized into the saved project.
 * §V16 forbids all three. So the hub is an ordinary out-of-document observable that the
 * backend, the frame driver and the compiler push into, and the UI samples.
 *
 * ## Rate
 *
 * Producers push at frame rate. Consumers are notified at most once per `intervalMs`
 * (100 ms — §V16's "<= 10 Hz" is a cap, not a target). The coalescing is here, in the
 * producer, not in each consumer: a consumer that forgets to throttle would otherwise
 * silently reintroduce a 60 Hz React render, and nothing would catch it.
 *
 * The hub also mirrors per-node `gpuMs` into the graph canvas's existing per-node runtime
 * channel through `NodeMetricSink`, which is deliberately a two-method structural type
 * rather than an import: `src/runtime` must not depend on `src/editor`, and there must be
 * exactly ONE per-node channel — the canvas already owns it and already coalesces, so we
 * publish into it rather than standing up a second one for nodes to subscribe to.
 *
 * ## Timing
 *
 * Every number in here comes from `PassTimingSource`, which the backend backs with vgpu's
 * `timer(gpu)` spans. Nothing in this module reads a clock to produce a duration. When
 * the device reports no timestamp query the hub never receives a span, and every bucket
 * it hands out reads `unavailable` (§V86, §V12).

   * The frame's cost (T1243).
   *
   * ## Why the per-pass spans are not summed into it any more
   *
   * They were, and the sum disagreed with the presented frame by ~10×: 88–105 ms on
   * E24 at a 10 ms rAF interval, 243–357 ms on E55 at 20–27 ms, and 4.98 → 55.2 ms
   * climbing with pass count on chain-200. Measured on Dawn/Metal with raw timestamps
   * (`scratchpad/ts-probe.ts`, 24 dependent 512² passes in one command buffer): the
   * BEGIN timestamp of every pass lands within ~0.1 ms of the command buffer's start
   * (0.000, 0.014, 0.026, 0.080, …) while the END timestamps are sequential (1.45,
   * 2.89, 4.32, …, 8.5). Apple GPUs sample pass timestamps at STAGE boundaries, and a
   * tile-based deferred renderer schedules every encoder's vertex stage up front, so
   * pass k's span is really "frame start → end of pass k". The spans NEST, and their
   * sum is ≈ (N+1)/2 × the frame — 11.7× for N = 24, which is the ratio that was
   * being shown. Not a queue wait inside a span (pass 0 begins at 0), and not preview
   * ticks leaking in (preview passes carry no span and are not in `plan.passes`).
   *
   * An empty marker pass at the end of the frame does not fix it either: with nothing
   * to wait for, its end timestamp landed at 1.5 ms of a 9 ms frame (`ts-probe2.ts`) —
   * the GPU overlaps independent passes wholesale. The only figure that is the frame is
   * earliest begin → latest end across the frame's spans, which vgpu now reports beside
   * the durations (`patches/vgpu.patch`, `Timer.onResults` second argument) and the
   * backend forwards as `FrameSpanExtent`.
   *
   * ## What the bucket carries
   *
   * `gpuMs` is that extent for the latest submit (`basis: "frame"`); `passSumMs` keeps
   * the sum so the per-pass column still adds up to something on screen. A source that
   * delivers no extent (a hand-driven fake) falls back to the sum and says so
   * (`basis: "passes"`) rather than reading null forever — every span in it is still a
   * measured GPU duration (§V86); it is the LABEL "frame" the sum never deserved.
   *
   * On a sequential GPU (no stage overlap) the two figures agree; the label costs
   * nothing there and is what stops the number from lying here.
