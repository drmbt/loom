/**
 * T1604b — WHERE THE DEVICE'S RENDER PASSES ARE.
 *
 * A plan pass of kind `draw` is one draw: its own id, shader, bindings, uniforms and node.
 * The device does not need a render pass for each. Opening one costs encode and submit time
 * on the CPU and, on a tile-based GPU, a store and a load of the target (and a resolve, when
 * it is multisampled), so two hundred draws into twenty targets were two hundred passes.
 *
 * A RUN is the draws one device render pass holds: consecutive `draw` passes of ONE NODE
 * into ONE TARGET, of which only the first may clear. Anything else ends it — an effect, a
 * dispatch, a swap, a loop marker, another target, another node, a draw that clears. So a
 * run is passes that were already adjacent and already drew over one another in this
 * order: grouping them moves nothing and changes no pixel.
 *
 * One node, because the run has ONE GPU timer span and the per-node figure must stay a
 * measurement: a span that covered two nodes' draws could only be divided between them by
 * invention. Inside the node the span belongs to the run, and its passes share it
 * (`runSpanName`); a person who wants each pass's own figure gets one pass per draw again
 * (`LoomBackend.setExactPassTiming`).
 *
 * A loop marker ends a run, so a substep region keeps its boundary: read off the plan as it
 * is written, never off the expanded order, where the body's last draw would sit next to
 * its own first.
 *
 * A MULTISAMPLED target is the exception: its draws stay a pass each. MEASURED, not
 * reasoned: with them grouped, sentinel-bot's colour (Dawn on Metal, rgba16float, 4× MSAA,
 * 640 × 360) differed from one pass per draw on 0 to 8 of 230,400 pixels a frame, each by
 * one unit in the last place of one channel, where two mesh-instanced geometries meet (the
 * claws on the last rings). Every single-sampled target was byte-identical. The cause was
 * NOT established: it did not need the document's own materials (the stock one showed it
 * too), and a built scene of 8,192 interpenetrating instanced meshes under three casting
 * lights did not show it at all. So this is a rule about what was seen, on the safe side of
 * it. Nobody could see
 * one unit in the last place; but the frame would then depend on `setExactPassTiming`,
 * that is on whether someone had the performance panel open, and every byte-exact gate
 * assumes it does not. Pass the plan's resources to have the rule applied; without them no
 * target is known to be multisampled.
 *
 * Pure, and the ONE definition: the encoder groups by it, and anything that describes what
 * the device does (the telemetry hub, the pipeline inspector) reads it rather than
 * restating the rule.
