/**
 * §T1695b (G6) — ONE PLACE JOINS AND SPLITS THE ID OF A NODE INSIDE AN INSTANCE.
 *
 * A node inside a component instance is named `<instance>/<node>` in the flattened document,
 * once per level. The census behind the session rule found eight roads across that boundary
 * and string code of their own in most of them (`docs/component-session-commands-design-
 * 2026-10-06.md` §1.6), and §T1216 had already recorded that `ComponentPath` means two
 * things, for one of which `.join("/")` gives `a/a/b`: a lookup that finds nothing and says
 * nothing. `src/domain/components/addressing.ts` is the one place now, and this is the gate
 * that keeps the next crossing from writing its own.
 *
 * ## How a site is found
 *
 * Every non-test file under the trees that handle documents is read for a line that names
 * `COMPONENT_ID_SEPARATOR`, calls `split`, `join`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `includes`,
 * `startsWith` or `endsWith` with the literal `"/"`, or writes `}/${` in a template. Each
 * file with such a line is in exactly one of three lists:
 *
 *  - `THE_JOINER`: the modules whose job it is.
 *  - `OWED`: files that still build or take apart a flattened id by hand, with how many
 *    lines. The count must match, so it can only be brought down, and a file leaves the
 *    list when it reaches the addressing module. A NEW file fails by name.
 *  - `NOT_A_NODE_PATH`: files whose slashes are something else, with what.
 *
 * ## What it cannot see
 *
 * A flattened id built without any of those forms (`[a, b].join(SEP)` under another name,
 * string concatenation with `+`), and a new id join added to a file already listed under
 * `NOT_A_NODE_PATH`. It reads the tree rather than importing what it checks, so no
 * dependency selector finds it: it is on `test:gates` (§V957).
