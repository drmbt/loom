/**
 * No per-frame CPU walk sees the UN-FLATTENED document (T615, §V437, §V464).
 *
 * ## The property, and why it is a property and not six fixes
 *
 * A component instance does not exist until the document is flattened. Every per-frame
 * CPU surface used to read `bus.store.getGraph()` instead, so nothing inside a component
 * existed for any of them: the value graph never evaluated an internal LFO, the driven
 * binding it fed resolved to `undefined`, `hasAnimatedParameters` answered false so
 * `compile.animate` was null and the component's internal EXPRESSIONS died with it, the
 * Analyze sampler never asked for a buffer the plan had allocated, and an expression-fired
 * pulse was never looked at. Six sites, one cause.
 *
 * §V437 is the invariant that says a requirement delivered site-by-site is not delivered.
 * So the answer is structural: `AppRuntime.flattened` is the ONE flattening, memoized per
 * `(document revision, catalogue revision)`, and every frame path reads it. This gate is
 * what keeps site N+1 from being wrong — it fails when a new raw read appears, not when
 * someone notices.
 *
 * ## §V464: it fails three ways, not one
 *
 *  (a) an UNDECLARED `store.getGraph` in a scanned file — the new site;
 *  (b) a STALE declaration whose read is gone — §V421's rot, so the table describes the
 *      code that exists rather than the code that used to;
 *  (c) a SECOND read inside an ALREADY-DECLARED file — declarations carry an exact COUNT,
 *      so one legitimate read in `use-graph-compile.ts` is not a blanket permission for
 *      the next one to join it.
 *
 * And the declaration lives in this file, which is text a person reads, with the REASON
 * each read is not a frame path spelled out — not in a machine-readable table nobody
 * opens.
 *
 * ## §V463: a text scan is not a semantic read
 *
 * Comments are stripped before the scan, because otherwise the prose in
 * `flattened-graph.ts` explaining the defect would itself count as a use. And the scan
 * cannot tell "is called once per frame" from "is called once per edit" — so it is paired
 * with `component-animation.test.ts`, which asserts the BEHAVIOUR on a real document with
 * two instances. Neither gate stands alone.
