/**
 * §T1556b — THE INPUT THE APP'S OWN DATA SENDS IS INPUT ITS COMMAND TAKES.
 *
 * The bus parses every command's input now, and a schema is strict: an unknown key is
 * refused. So a keymap binding, a menu row or a pulse template whose input does not fit its
 * command is no longer a handler quietly ignoring a field — it is a key that does nothing
 * but log a refusal (B87's shape: everything registered, guarded, labelled and invoked, and
 * the dispatch lands nothing). These three tables are DATA, typed loosely
 * (`Record<string, unknown>`), so the compiler cannot hold them to the command's input; this
 * does, against the schema the bus will parse them with.
 *
 * What is checked is what the data says on its own: a binding's static input with its
 * `inputFrom` filled the way the engine fills it, a menu row's static input where no builder
 * replaces it, a pulse's template with its node substituted. A command no product entry point
 * registers headlessly (the hook-registered ones) is skipped and counted, so the gate cannot
 * pass by reading nothing.
