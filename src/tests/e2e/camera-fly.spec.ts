 * §T970 — FLY A CAMERA FROM THE VIEWER. THE REAL GESTURES, ON THE REAL GPU.
 *
 * The owner, twice: "i'm still missing a way to actually change the position of the camera
 * in the camera node via flying around in that preview instead of manually having to deal
 * with it". The viewer locks to the camera its picture is drawn through, by a button that
 * names it, and then its drag, wheel and fly keys are edits to that camera.
 *
 * Every claim here is on what the user has afterwards: the camera's STORED pose, read off
 * the inspector's own fields, and the picture on the glass. Not "the handler ran".
 *
 * GPU LANE ONLY (`playwright.config.ts` routes it by basename): the viewer has a picture,
 * and a plan is installed at all, only on a real adapter.
