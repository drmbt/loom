/**
 * T1655b — EVERY 3D PREVIEW OFFERS A CAMERA THAT ANSWERS A DRAG, OR SAYS WHY NOT. THE APP'S HALF.
 *
 * `compiler/preview-camera-coverage.test.ts` holds that the compiler SAYS it for every node
 * type in the registry. This holds that the app DOES it, on the real GPU, for the handful
 * of cases the walk found broken while every unit suite was green:
 *
 *  - the VIEWER presented a pointset on a second canvas and kept its orbit gestures on the
 *    first, which is hidden: the bar said "drag to orbit" and no drag moved it. jsdom
 *    dispatches to a hidden element, so the tests that dragged it passed (§V461);
 *  - a camera with exactly ONE Render had no control at all, because it borrows that
 *    Render's row and the gizmo asked a field the borrowed row does not have;
 *  - a camera NOTHING renders through had the control, and its own tile did not move when
 *    the drag wrote the pose: a synthesized tile never saw a values-only edit;
 *  - a Render and a fully driven camera showed an empty corner, which is what a broken
 *    control shows.
 *
 * Every claim is asserted on what the user sees or on what the document holds: tile pixels
 * taken off the glass, the inspector's own number, the sentence on the tile. Never a class
 * name, and never "the handler was called".
 *
 * GPU LANE ONLY (`playwright.config.ts` routes it by basename): a tile is live, and a plan
 * is installed at all, only on a real adapter.
