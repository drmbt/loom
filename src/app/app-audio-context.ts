/**
 * §T1548b — THE APP'S ONE `AudioContext`.
 *
 * Movie sound goes through Web Audio (the owner's ruling, 2026-10-04), and so does Audio
 * File In / Audio In capture (`use-audio-input.ts`). They share this context: two would be
 * two output streams on two clocks. It is made on first ask and never closed — a
 * `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` belongs to its context for the element's life, so a context
 * that closed under a routed movie would leave that movie silent with no way back. A
 * capture that ends disconnects its nodes instead.
 *
 * A context made before the page has had a user gesture starts SUSPENDED (Chrome's
 * autoplay policy). So this listens, in the capture phase, for the first pointer, key or
 * touch and resumes it there, on the gesture's own stack; the listeners go once it runs.
 * Until then a routed movie is kept muted (`createMovieAudioPlayback`), because an UNMUTED
 * routed element nearly stops its clock while its context is suspended (measured in
 * Chrome: 0.002 s of media in 1 s of wall; muted, 0.978 s).
 *
 * Null where there is no Web Audio (jsdom, an old engine): movies then play through their
 * own element output, as they did before T1548b.
