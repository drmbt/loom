   *  - `nodesInitialized`, React Flow's own "every node has been MEASURED". Fitting
   *    unmeasured nodes computes the bounds of zero-sized points, which is a centre with
   *    no extent, and the zoom clamps to `maxZoom` (8). "Centred, at 8×" is a new
   *    complaint, not a fix.
   *  - the fit covered THE GRAPH THIS PANE WAS GIVEN. The dive changes `componentPath`
   *    and `graph` in one commit while React Flow catches up in its own, so an eager fit
   *    can frame the PARENT's nodes perfectly and report success — §V123's silence again,
   *    one layer up. Counting is what tells the two apart, so the debt stays owed until
   *    the count agrees and is retried by the next commit that changes either input.
   *
   * Through the command, not `flow.fitView`: `view.frameAll` is already the one correct
   * handler on the right bus (T1195), so this is the same code path a keystroke takes and
   * the derived gate in `component-boundary-surfaces.test.tsx` keeps covering it.
