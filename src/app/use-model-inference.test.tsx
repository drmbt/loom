/**
 * THE CONSTRUCTION SITE FOR THE MODEL NOTICES (B156, §V205, §T743).
 *
 * §T385 built a Depth node that renders its identity fallback when no model is held, so
 * that a document opens on a machine that cannot run it. §T759 shipped E44 Sounding as the
 * first example to exercise that path: with no weights it is a flat lattice over the live
 * plate, "clean and deliberate, not broken". The owner opened it and reported it as "not
 * really doing anything" — which is exactly what a flat lattice looks like.
 *
 * The only thing separating "correct and unavailable" from "broken" was one notice, and
 * §T743's worker had already written down that this notice is LOAD-BEARING. It had NO
 * TEST. `useModelInference` and `buildNotices` had no test of any kind — the factory
 * (acquisition, the seam, the worker runner) was covered end to end and the CONSTRUCTION
 * SITE, where they meet the document and the screen, was not. That is §V205's shape, and
 * it is why a green suite said nothing about a document the owner could not read.
 *
 * So these assert the SENTENCE, not the mechanism: for a real example document whose star
 * node has no model, a person must be told what is on the screen.

 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A REPLACED BACKEND GETS THE INFERENCE RESULT REGISTERED ON IT (T1044)
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The owner's matte was intermittent across one page: nothing, nothing, a clean silhouette
 * after a refresh, then nothing again — same document, same weights, same machine. A stale
 * build is stable, so intermittence on one page is a lifecycle fault, and this is the one
 * in this file.
 *
 * `track` remembers its media-source registrations in a map keyed by SOURCE ID ALONE and
 * skips any id already in it. The id does not change when the BACKEND does, so a second
 * backend never receives the `infer:` registration the first one got — and an external
 * texture with no registered source is never uploaded (`uploadExternalTextures` skips it),
 * which renders as a matte of zero everywhere. That is pixel-for-pixel the no-model
 * picture, the no-result picture and the empty-room picture, so nothing anywhere says it
 * happened: `ready` is 1, the coverage channel reports a real number, the node info popup
 * reports a backend and a millisecond figure, and the picture is black.
 *
 * `use-media-sources.ts` cannot have this bug because its whole open-and-register effect
 * is keyed on `[backend, ...]` and tears down with it. This seam registers from a callback
 * and observes backend identity nowhere, and that asymmetry is the defect.
 *
 * WHEN A BACKEND IS REPLACED, in a build the owner is actually running: `sharedGpuProbe`
 * memoises the device in a MODULE-level variable, so a Vite HMR update that replaces
 * `gpu-status.ts` — or any module it re-exports through — resets that memo and the next
 * render gets a new backend object. The owner watches a live dev page while several
 * sessions commit, which makes this a routine event rather than an exotic one.
 *
 * Asserted as WHAT THE SECOND BACKEND WAS TOLD, not as the shape of the map: the consumer
 * of this seam is the backend's media registry, and what it needs is a source it can pull
 * frames from.
