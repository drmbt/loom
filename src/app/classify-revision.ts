/**
 * What changed between two document revisions, as the compiler's own edit vocabulary
 * (T308, B26, §V5).
 *
 * `classifyEdit` has existed, been exported and been unit-tested since T31 with NO
 * PRODUCTION CALLER: every document revision re-ran the whole compiler and every one of
 * them reached `backend.compile`. Measured, before this landed: five value-only parameter
 * edits produced five `compileGraph` calls, five `backend.compile` calls and ZERO
 * `updateUniforms`. §V5's uniform-only path was not merely unenforced — for a static edit
 * it did not exist, because the only way a new value reached the GPU was by rebuilding
 * the plan. This module is the missing input to the classifier.
 *
 * ## Why a document DIFF and not the patch's operations
 *
 * The patch knows what it did, but it is not the only thing that changes a document: undo
 * and redo replay inverses, and an agent's patch arrives by the same door as a human's.
 * Classifying the RESULT covers all of them with one rule. It is also cheap in exactly
 * the way that matters — the store applies patches through immer, so an untouched node
 * keeps its object identity and the diff is a walk of reference comparisons, not a deep
 * equality check.
 *
 * ## A LOAD is not an edit (T519, B106)
 *
 * A project load is the one revision this diff must NOT be asked about, and the header
 * above said so for months while the code went on diffing anyway: "a project load
 * replaces everything" was written down and never enforced. Two documents that share
 * node NAMES share node IDS — `noise1`, `ramp1`, `out` is what everyone gets, and `out`
 * is in every shipped example — so a node whose parameters happen to coincide diffs as
 * unchanged and keeps its cached texture, its temporal history and its compiled pass.
 * The picture that comes back is the PREVIOUS PROJECT'S.
 *
 * The correction is not more unique ids. Uniqueness would paper over the defect, break
 * the id stability other things rely on, and leave the bug live for the next two
 * documents that still collide. What was missing is DOCUMENT IDENTITY: this classifies
 * two revisions OF A DOCUMENT, and two revisions of DIFFERENT documents are not a diff
 * at all. So the input is a `DocumentRevision` — an identity paired with a graph — and a
 * revision that crosses an identity boundary is a full rebuild regardless of what the
 * contents happen to be. It is a TYPE change on purpose: a caller cannot forget to say
 * which document it is talking about, which is the only way this stays fixed.
 *
 * ## Conservative in one direction only
 *
 * `classifyEdit`'s own rule, inherited here: when this cannot prove an edit is cheap it
 * asks for MORE work, never less. Every unrecognised difference — a field nobody has
 * classified, a node type change, a document shape this build has not seen — comes out as
 * `topology`, which recompiles. The failure mode of guessing "cheap" is a stale picture
 * that no further editing repairs; the failure mode of guessing "expensive" is the
 * behaviour that shipped for the last four months.
 *
 * And the answer is CHECKED rather than trusted: the caller hands the decision to a push
 * that asserts `isUniformOnlyChange` against the real plans and refuses if they disagree
 * (`animate-parameters.ts`), so a wrong classification here costs a recompile, not a
 * wrong frame.

/**
 * T1652b — A VALUES-ONLY REVISION, defined ONCE. Every reader that asks "did only a value
 * move" asks `classifyRevision`; there is no second copy of this rule in a hook or a pane.
 *
 * ## Why it exists
 *
 * A slider moved by a hand (the Controls tab, the inspector, a phone, MIDI) is a document
 * revision like any other, and every revision re-rendered the composition root and re-ran
 * some twenty whole-document passes behind it: the structural compile, the requirement
 * diagnostics, the reference lines, every pane. Measured on a 152-node document: 57 to
 * 66 ms on the main thread per write, linear in the document and not in what changed. A
 * revision of this kind is not an event for the root (`revision-watch.ts`): its values
 * take the compiler's values lane (`rebaseOnValues`) and the surfaces that show a value
 * hear it themselves.
 *
 * ## What it IS
 *
 * Between two revisions of one document, EVERYTHING is the same object except, on one or
 * more nodes, stored parameters where:
 *
 *  - a STATIC literal moved: a number, a boolean, or a tuple of numbers of the same
 *    length (a vector, a colour), bare or as the `static` binding of a slot;
 *  - the slot's MODE and every other binding are the same objects;
 *  - the key is one no definition calls STRUCTURAL (`structuralParameterKeys`: declared
 *    `compileTime`, or read by a parameter resolution policy);
 *  - the node's EFFECTIVE SCHEMA is the same schema before and after (`parametersFor`:
 *    the same object, or one built anew that says the same), and every `inactiveWhen` of
 *    that schema answers the same before and after;
 *  - no HOST service reads the node's values off the root's document (`hostServed`).
 *
 * and, beside those, a bank or a cue list recording a recall it just made (`current`,
 * `standby`, `morphs`): the picture's values in that revision are the targets' numbers,
 * the record is which preset the holder shows as current and which fades it started. That
 * is what lets a recall of thirty values be ONE values pass.
 *
 * ## What it is NOT (each sends the revision down the structural road, by name)
 *
 *  - a node added, removed, renamed, moved or resized; a wire; a group; the viewport;
 *  - a UI field (preview, bypass, pin), a resolution, a format, a channel mask;
 *  - a parameter stored for the first time, or one removed (the key set moved);
 *  - a MODE change, an expression's source, a bind, a map, a driven channel;
 *  - a STRING of any kind: an enum, a name another node is read by, a file, a caption, a
 *    board, shader or preset text. And a ramp's stops or any other structured value;
 *  - a key the definitions call structural (a Light's kind, a count that sizes a buffer);
 *  - a value the node's own SCHEMA follows (`parametersFor`: a control's stored default,
 *    a grid's rows) or that changes what APPLIES (`inactiveWhen`);
 *  - any parameter of a node a host service reads (`hostServed`: a movie, a camera, a
 *    Text, an audio track, a mesh, a model, a Syphon or NDI session, a window, OSC, the
 *    laser), of a node whose runtime requirements are chosen by a value (`requires` as a
 *    function), of a component instance (flattening writes its values onto the
 *    internals), or of a type this build does not have.
 *
 * Conservative in one direction, like the classifier above: every doubt is `structure`,
 * which costs what every revision cost before this existed. `reason` says which rule
 * refused, so a write that should have been cheap and was not can be found (the
 * performance panel counts them).
 *
 * It answers about the DOCUMENT. Whether the compiled plan can follow without a structural
 * compile is the lane's own question, asked against the plan under §V936's verifier, and
 * a refusal there escalates the same way.
