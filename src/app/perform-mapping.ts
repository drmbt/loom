/**
 * §T1536b — WHICH MAPPING NODE A PERFORM WINDOW CAN EDIT, AND WHERE ITS HANDLES LAND THERE.
 *
 * Mapping is done looking at the projector, so a Window Out's "edit mapping" mode draws the
 * handles of the Corner Pin / Grid Warp upstream of it ON the perform window. A handle's
 * value lives in the mapping node's OWN picture (normalised, y up — the T935/§T1491b picture
 * handle), and the window shows that picture after everything downstream of the node. This
 * module answers the two questions that decides, purely, so a test can call them:
 *
 *  1. `mappingTargetsOf` — the mapping nodes on the window's input chain, nearest first, each
 *     with `null` when its picture reaches the window exactly mappable, or the named reason it
 *     does not; and the Corner Pins its picture goes through on the way (§T1538b).
 *  2. `pictureLensFor` — those Corner Pins as exact maps of the picture (`LensStep`s), or the
 *     named refusal of a degenerate one.
 *  3. `windowPicture` — the exact map between the mapping node's picture and the window's CSS
 *     pixels: through the lens, then the Window Out's Fit (the shader's `placed`, restated),
 *     then the canvas's `object-fit: contain` of the W×H target into the window.
 *
 * The viewer pane asks the same questions (§T1536b, viewer slice): `mappingTargetsAt` walks
 * from the node the viewer shows (itself first), and `viewerPicture` is its frame — the lens,
 * then the viewer's own contain-fit, with no Fit step.
 *
 * ## Exact, or refused — never guessed
 *
 * Between the mapping node and the window only nodes that keep every point of the picture
 * where it was (in normalised coordinates) are crossed: a bypassed node and a declared
 * passthrough (a wire, §T250), and the colour-only nodes in `GEOMETRY_PRESERVING`. Anything
 * else — a Transform, a Crop, a Flip, a Grid Warp, a composite, a node this list has never
 * heard of — REFUSES that target with the blocking node named. The list fails closed on
 * purpose: a node missing from it costs a refusal the operator can read; a node wrongly on it
 * would put a handle where the parameter is not.
 *
 * ## A Corner Pin is crossed exactly (§T1538b)
 *
 * The documented stack is Grid Warp → Corner Pin (the outer perspective), so a Corner Pin is
 * the one warp that does NOT block: it is an invertible homography, and its own CPU solve
 * (`squareToQuad`, `invertMat3`, `outputToSquare` — imported, never restated) gives the map
 * both ways. A point of its input goes extract quad → unit square → pin quad (forward, for
 * drawing); a window point goes back the shader's way, pin quad → unit square → extract quad
 * (inverse, for a drag). Corner Pins chain, so a Corner Pin behind a Corner Pin is edited
 * through the one in front. The quads are read, through the node's own reader, from the
 * parameters RESOLVED as the window shows them (the last rendered frame, channels, morphs).
 *
 * Refused, by name: a Corner Pin whose Pin or Extract quad is degenerate (the node's own
 * `quadDegeneracy` — its `cornerPin.pin/extract.degenerate` warning, on which it renders
 * nothing, so nothing behind it has a place), and a handle whose point lies past a Corner
 * Pin's horizon (the homogeneous w is not positive: the shader shows nothing there in any
 * Outside mode, and the projective division would put the handle on the wrong side).
 * NOT refused: a handle outside the Extract quad. It is drawn where the pinned plane,
 * continued, puts it — clamp-free, so it may sit outside the pin quad or off the window — and
 * drags from there exactly. The Corner Pin does not show that point (Outside continues the
 * Extract quad's own content in every mode, never the input beyond it), but the position is
 * still the true one, and a clamped or hidden handle could not be dragged back in. Hold Edge /
 * Repeat / Mirror copies are not handles: each point is drawn at its one homography position.
 *
 * A resolution change on a crossed node does not matter: the picture is stretched to the new
 * size in normalised coordinates, and Fit reads the size the Window Out actually samples
 * (`inputSize`, off the compiled plan), not the mapping node's.
 *
 * ## Which one, when there are several
 *
 * Every Corner Pin / Grid Warp on the chain is listed (the inspector picks), nearest first;
 * the nearest is the default. One behind Corner Pins only is placed through them (§T1538b);
 * one behind any other warp is listed with that refusal rather than hidden — the operator
 * sees it exists and why it cannot be dragged here. The chain past a non-preserving node is followed through the node's
 * resolution input (the input its picture derives from) only to list what lies beyond; a
 * node with none ends the walk. Nodes inside a component are not reached (the walk reads the
 * document root, where Window Outs live).
