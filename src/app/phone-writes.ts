/**
 * T1396b — A PHONE'S WRITES, THROUGH THE BUS, AS THAT PHONE.
 *
 * Every write a phone sends is vetted against the document as it is now
 * (`vetPhoneSet`) and applied through a parameter editor whose actor IS the phone:
 * kind `human` (a person moved it, with a finger), id `remote-<phone>` (`phoneActorId`).
 * The actor union is not widened for this — a phone is a person somewhere else, and
 * everything keyed by actor (undo stacks, audit entries, grants) already does the right
 * thing with a distinct id:
 *
 *  - **undo is per phone.** One editor per phone, so a drag from a phone is live frames
 *    plus a commit sharing ONE transaction — one undo group on that phone's stack, never
 *    on the desk's (§V15, §V41);
 *  - **the audit names the phone** — every applied patch is an entry whose actor id is
 *    `remote-<phone>` (§V31);
 *  - **grants do not follow** — `viewportControl` is granted to the page's own actor by
 *    id (`app-runtime.ts`), so a phone holds none; it only ever sends `graph.applyPatch`
 *    with one `setParameters`, which needs none. `selectCreatedNodes` returns early
 *    without `createdIds`, which a parameter write never has, so a phone cannot move
 *    the desk's selection through it either.
 *
 * ## Why a button waits for its own write
 *
 * A press is counted on the false→true edge of `held`, read from the document. A phone
 * sends press and release back to back, and the parameter editor coalesces live values
 * to a frame — so without waiting, the release would be vetted against a document that
 * does not have the press yet, and would write the old count over the new one. So each
 * phone's writes run in order on one chain, and a button write (or any commit) waits
 * for the editor to settle before the next is vetted. A slider's live frames do not
 * wait: they only need clamping, and waiting would undo the per-frame coalescing.
 *
 * ## Banks, layers and cue lists (T1503b, §T1398b ruling 12)
 *
 * A vetted write is one of three things (`PhoneVet.action`). `parameters` is the editor
 * path above. `command` is one of the vet's four — recall, GO, BACK, standby — run on the
 * bus under the phone's actor, so the audit says `human remote-<phone>` did it and its
 * one undo group lands on that phone's stack; the command and its input are the VET's,
 * never the phone's, and the vet names no Store. `layerOn` is one `setNodeUi { bypassed }`
 * written as the state asked for, and not at all when the layer is already so — the
 * desk's own rule (`board-members.tsx`), so a double tap is one undo step, not a flip
 * back. Both wait for the editor to settle first and run on the phone's lane: a press
 * sent after a fader lift lands after it.
 *
 * ## A refusal names its control (T1526b)
 *
 * Every refusal is reported with the control it is about, so the phone that pressed can be
 * shown the sentence on that control (`use-phone-door.ts` sends it; the desk's notice is
 * unchanged). The control is the VET's node id, never the handle the phone sent: a write
 * that named nothing published is reported with none. Three classes, one report each:
 * the vet refused; the bus REJECTED the command or patch; the bus answered CONFLICT (the
 * desk changed the same node between the vet and the write). A conflict on a press used
 * to be dropped without a word here; it is said now, in the bus's own sentence.
