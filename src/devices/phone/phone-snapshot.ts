/**
 * T1396b — WHAT A PHONE MAY SEE, AND WHETHER WHAT IT SENT MAY BE WRITTEN. The page's half
 * of the phone door's policy, pure and headless: a document in, a snapshot or a patch out.
 *
 * ## One rule decides both, so they cannot disagree
 *
 * `publishedWidgets` is the ONLY place that decides which widget a phone can reach. The
 * snapshot draws from it and the vet checks against it, so a widget the phone was never
 * shown is a widget it cannot write — including one that WAS shown a moment ago on a Panel
 * whose Phone switch has since been turned off, because the vet re-reads the document on
 * every write rather than trusting what it last sent. A handle is the widget node's id: a
 * phone that guesses another node's id reaches the same refusal as one that sends garbage.
 *
 * ## Members come from the one Panel derivation
 *
 * Which widgets a Panel shows, and in what order, is `panelLayout` (`controls.ts`, T1512b):
 * the widgets wired into it in wiring order, or its layout override's names resolved by
 * `node.label ?? node.id` — the SAME function the Panel's canvas body and the Controls tab
 * draw from, so the phone cannot show another order than the desk. It reads the DOCUMENT
 * graph, so a widget inside a component is invisible to a Panel outside it — T1143's
 * missing publish surface. A name with no widget behind it is dropped (the desk prints
 * "no control named …"; a phone has nothing to do with that line).
 *
 * ## A driven widget is not published
 *
 * A key the document DRIVES (an expression, a bind) is not the user's to move — the
 * editor's own widget draws "driven" and refuses the gesture. The phone contract has no
 * read-only widget, so the simplest correct answer is to leave such a widget out of the
 * snapshot and refuse a write to it. "Driven" here means a slot whose mode is not
 * `static`; a slot in static mode holds a plain value in its static binding and a bare
 * write updates that binding (`apply-patch.ts`, §V108), so it is published like a plain
 * value. Every key the phone reads or writes counts — a slider with an expression on its
 * Max is left out too, because the range the phone would draw is not the range in force.
 * The Panel's own Phone switch follows the same rule: only a plain (or static) `true`
 * publishes it; a switch an expression flips is not a door an expression gets to open.
 *
 * ## Banks, layers and cue lists (T1503b, §T1398b ruling 12)
 *
 * A Presets bank, a Layer and a Cue List join a Panel's BOARD by name (`panelBoard`, T1501b),
 * and a phone reaches exactly the ones on a board whose Panel has Phone on —
 * `publishedMembers`, the same one-rule-for-both as the widgets. What a phone may do to one
 * is recall a preset, switch a layer and move its opacity, and GO / BACK / stand a cue by.
 * `PHONE_COMMANDS` is every bus command the vet can name, and Store and Delete are not in
 * it: there is no key a phone can send that the vet turns into either.
 *
 * A layer whose opacity the document drives IS published, unlike a driven widget: its
 * switch is still the phone's to press. The fader is marked not writable
 * (`opacityWritable`), and a write to it is refused.
