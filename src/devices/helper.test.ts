/**
 * ONE SPELLING OF THE COMMAND, AND A GATE THAT SAYS SO (T1110, §V39).
 *
 * ## Why this test exists
 *
 * T1103 wrote that `helper.ts` is "THE ONE PLACE THAT NAMES THE COMMAND", and it was not
 * true: `domain/osc/osc-status.ts` spelled it twice and four node descriptions spelled it
 * once each — six user-facing sentences that a rename would have left saying the old name,
 * beside the seven refusals that would have said the new one. A product answering "what do I
 * run?" with two different commands is worse than one that answers with the wrong one.
 *
 * The claim was a paragraph in a docblock, and this repo's own history (§V901's reasoning)
 * says a paragraph decays. So the claim is a gate now. It scans the source the way
 * `copy-guard.test.ts` does, because the fact being defended is about what a HUMAN READS,
 * and no type can see that.
 *
 * ## What it forbids, precisely
 *
 * The literal `pnpm <script>` form inside a STRING OR TEMPLATE LITERAL, in any file under
 * `src/` except this one and the module that owns it — including the retired name, so a
 * stale sentence is caught as loudly as a duplicated fresh one.
 *
 * String literals and not raw text, because the fact being defended is about what the
 * PRODUCT SAYS. A docblock naming the command is documentation that can go stale; a string
 * literal naming it is a second command in the user's face, and only one of those is the
 * failure this gate exists for. Parsed rather than pattern-matched, because "is this inside
 * a comment" is not a question a regex answers — the same reason `copy-guard.test.ts` walks
 * the AST. A template literal that INTERPOLATES the constant carries none of its text and
 * so passes, which is exactly the fix this gate is asking for.
 *
 * A bare `"mcp:serve"` (the alias constant in `client-config.ts`, which exists so a test can
 * assert `package.json` still carries the alias) is not a command a user is told to type,
 * and is deliberately not matched.

/**
 * T1344b — THE README IS OUTSIDE `src/`, WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW IT FELL BEHIND.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for, as it actually happened
 *
 * `--terminal` shipped in §T1263 with its own door, its own opt-in flag and its own copy,
 * and the README never learned about it — the word appeared NOWHERE in 240 lines that
 * documented `pnpm helper`, `--devices-only` and `--grant-export`. The T1110 gate above
 * walks `src/` and cannot see a file one directory up, so the one document a new user reads
 * first is the one document nothing checked.
 *
 * ## Why this gate and not a bigger one
 *
 * §V1003's amendment says a gate nobody runs is worse than none, and this project's CI runs
 * no tests at all. So this is deliberately the cheapest thing that would have caught it: a
 * `readFileSync` and a substring, in a file ALREADY named in `test:gates` — no new script
 * entry, no `gate-list` exemption, nothing anyone has to remember to run. The subjects are
 * DERIVED from the module's own exports rather than listed here, so the fifth command
 * constant somebody adds is red in the README on the day they add it, which is the property
 * a hand-maintained list would not have.
 *
 * ## Blind spot, stated
 *
 * This proves the README SPELLS each command correctly, not that the prose around it is
 * true. A section that describes `--terminal` wrongly still passes. What it removes is the
 * silent case — a command that exists in the product and is absent from, or misspelled in,
 * the document that teaches it.
