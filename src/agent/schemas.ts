/**
 * Tool input schemas — the "schema" half of "transport plus schema" (§V39, §V66).
 *
 * Everything an agent sends is untrusted input at a process boundary, so it is validated
 * structurally BEFORE it reaches the bus: a malformed patch comes back as a diagnostic,
 * never as a raw throw or an unhandled rejection (§V66).
 *
 * The patch-operation SHAPE is no longer this boundary's own. It used to be — with a
 * comment saying it "mirrors `@domain/types/patch.ts` exactly and must be updated with
 * it" — and it did not: six operations from four separate tasks landed in the domain
 * union and never arrived here, so `setNodeSize`, `reorderEdges` and the whole group and
 * viewport family existed in the document and were unreachable for an agent. A mirror
 * maintained by remembering is a mirror that drifts, and nothing failed when it did.
 * `graphPatchOperationSchema` in `src/domain/types/schemas.ts` is now the one shape, and
 * `patch-ops.test.ts` proves it covers the TypeScript union exactly.
 *
 * What stays here is POLICY, which is a different thing from shape and is the reason
 * this file still has an opinion at all — see the refinement below.
 *
 * Every object is `.strict()`. An unknown key is a caller mistake worth reporting — and
 * it is also how a fabricated `capabilities` field gets refused instead of ignored
 * (§V38).

/**
 * T1208 — `driven` IS REFUSED AT THIS BOUNDARY, and the owner's question is why it needed
 * to be: *"we should have absolutely and totally removed that. How can the agent still do
 * that?"*
 *
 * §T897 retired the mode and put three guards on it — it is off the mode buttons
 * (`AUTHORABLE_PARAMETER_MODES`), `parameter.setMode` refuses switching into it, and a
 * loaded document is upgraded (`upgradeDrivenSlot`, one mapping, parse forever emit never).
 * Every one of those sits on a route that changes ONE mode. A patch writes the WHOLE SLOT
 * in a single operation and asks none of them, so the surface that publishes the mode enum
 * was also the one surface that would still take it.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY HERE AND NOT IN THE DOMAIN VALIDATOR, WHICH WOULD COVER EVERY ENTRANCE. Measured
 * before choosing: `driven` slots are still authored through `graph.applyPatch` by ~10 test
 * files across four tracks, because the RESOLVER still reads the mode (`resolve.ts` case
 * "driven"), as do liveness, parameter-dependencies, names and the reference lines.
 * Refusing the write while nine other files still speak the mode is half a removal, and it
 * breaks its own suite. The total removal the owner asked for is a real piece of work with
 * a versioned-load decision in it; this closes the AGENT hole he actually reported, and the
 * residual is named rather than implied.
 *
 * The refusal carries the replacement, built from the caller's own channel through the same
 * mapping the load-time upgrade uses (T1207: a refusal with no next move is a dead end).
