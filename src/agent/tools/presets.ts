/**
 * Preset banks and the cue list (T1502b, §T1398b S7 — the design doc §10).
 *
 * Nine adapters over commands that already exist: `preset.store` / `preset.recall` /
 * `preset.delete` (§T1496b, §T1497b, §T1499b) and `cue.go` / `cue.back` / `cue.fire` /
 * `cue.setStandby` with the `cue.list` query (§T1500b). Each tool forwards its input and
 * projects the command's own output; the planner, the one-patch rule, the undo step, the
 * audit entry and every refusal's sentence are the commands' (§V39). A refusal comes back
 * as the command's `rejected` with its diagnostics untouched.
 *
 * ## No capability class (§V38)
 *
 * A store, a recall, a delete and a GO are graph edits: undoable, audited and
 * actor-stamped, and nothing leaves the document. `capabilities.ts` says why those are
 * ungated, and these are no exception.
 *
 * ## What the SCREEN did is its own field
 *
 * A recall with a morph commits the END values at once and writes a record the picture
 * fades along — on the app's transport. A bus with no app (the headless server) has no
 * transport, so the same recall is a cut there, and the command says so in an `info`
 * diagnostic. An agent that reads `morph` in its own input and "ok" in the status would
 * report a fade nobody saw, so every tool that fires a recall projects three plain fields:
 * `transition` ("morph" / "cut" / "none"), `morphUnavailable`, and the `record` the
 * command wrote, read back from the bank it wrote it to.
 *
 * ## `list_presets` has no query behind it
 *
 * `cue.list` is a bus query; a bank's listing is not, so this reads `graph.get` and parses
 * the bank with the domain's own parsers — the same shape of projection `get_node` is.
 * A preset's `morph` is §5.1's ladder as `presetMorph` computes it, never a second copy.
 *
 * ## Not held for review
 *
 * These carry no `preview`, so a surface built with `requireApproval` runs them without a
 * card, as it does `layout_graph` and `import_component`: the operations are the
 * planner's, and deriving them here would be a second planner.
 *
 * Untrusted text (§V37): bank, preset and cue names travel in `data`. The messages this
 * file authors quote only the id the caller passed in.
