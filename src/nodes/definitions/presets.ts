/**
 * T1496b (§T1398b S1, ruling 1) — Presets: a BANK of named parameter snapshots, as a node.
 *
 * Store captures the bank's `targets` (whole nodes, or single `node.key`) as whole stored
 * slots; Recall writes one back as ONE patch — one revision, one undo step, one
 * `preset.recall` audit entry. Both are bus commands (`src/domain/presets/commands.ts`),
 * so the inspector, a Panel, a pulse, an agent and the phone reach the same code.
 *
 * WHY A NODE (the design doc §4.2): the bank's data lives in its PARAMETERS, so undo,
 * autosave, copy/paste, save-as-component, component export and the agent's `get_graph`
 * all carry it with nothing built for them — the MIDI mapping's argument (`midi.ts`).
 * `node.state` would not survive paste and no patch operation writes it.
 *
 * No ports and no passes, like Panel: it reads its targets only when Store or Recall
 * runs, never per frame, so it is not a dependency of anything and prune never keeps it.
 *
 * T1497b — MORPH. `morph` and `curve` are the bank's default way of carrying a recall out
 * (a preset's own `morph`, or the recall's, overrides them); `morphs` holds the fades in
 * flight, written by Recall in the same patch as the values. Added with defaults, so no
 * migration and no version bump, exactly as Panel's `remote` was. The node still reads
 * no clock (§V44) and still has no passes: the fade is the resolver's, on the frame's
 * absolute clock, and the recall command reads the frame clock the app attached.

    "A bank of presets: named snapshots of the parameters of the nodes in Targets, stored and recalled whole. Targets lists node names (every parameter of that node — for a component, its published page) or node.key (one parameter), separated by spaces or commas. Store saves them under a name; Recall writes every one back in one step that one undo reverses, expressions and modes included. A target that has since been deleted, or a value that no longer fits, is skipped with a warning naming it; a recall with nothing left to apply is refused. The Recall pulse recalls the preset named in Select, so a MIDI pad, a beat or a Button can fire it. With Morph above zero a recall fades to its values instead of cutting. Use one bank per look, per FX chain, or per set of layers.",
