/**
 * Window Out — a perform window on a chosen screen (§T1391b; TouchDesigner's Window COMP).
 *
 * The owner: *"an easier way to open a perform window … at any screen that is connected …
 * configure which screen and resolution … with a single click"*. The node is the
 * configuration (T960: everything is a node, not a device pane) and its own render target
 * is the picture the window shows, 1:1 — Width × Height, with the input placed by Fit.
 *
 * ## A display sink, not the picture
 *
 * `sink: true` with `sinkRole: "display"`: it draws into its own `$target`, but it is never
 * what the viewer presents or what render-out writes, and it is ACTIVE ONLY WHILE ITS
 * WINDOW IS OPEN (the app names it as a sink then; the owner ruled a closed window costs
 * nothing). A headless compile never opens a window, so there it renders nothing.
 *
 * ## What it shows
 *
 * The wired `input`, or — the TD Window COMP's path — the node NAMED in Source, through the
 * same by-name reference Feedback and Render use (a dashed line on the canvas). The owner
 * ruled both, so the reference declares `wire: true` (B233): with a wire AND a name the
 * wire wins and the name is dormant until the wire is taken away
 * (`domain/graph/source-references.ts`).
 *
 * ## The window's own settings
 *
 * Screen, Fullscreen and Hide cursor are read by the app when it opens the window, never by
 * the compiler: they change nothing in the plan. Screen is a display's label as the browser
 * reports it (`ScreenDetailed.label`); empty means Auto — a screen other than the editor's.
 *
 * The size is Width × Height from the node's own parameters (T151's parameter policy), so
 * "Match screen" in the inspector writes the chosen display's physical pixels here, in one
 * place; the generic per-node resolution override is not offered for this node.
