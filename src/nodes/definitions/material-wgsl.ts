/**
 * T1355b — MATERIAL · WGSL: a material whose SURFACE is code. TouchDesigner's GLSL MAT.
 *
 * The stock materials fix what a surface is (a colour, a roughness) and the Render fixes
 * how it is lit. This one hands the first half to the author: a `fn surface(s: SurfaceIn,
 * p: Params) -> SurfaceOut` that runs once per pixel of every surface wearing it, BEFORE
 * lighting, and returns the albedo, roughness, metallic, normal and emissive the chosen
 * lighting model then shades. Molten metal that flows, grime keyed to height and heat, a
 * scan band that glitches one material — all per pixel, all lit the same way as everything
 * else, none of it a post effect pretending to know where a surface is.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT the author writes against (the generator emits these; see
 * `sceneSurfaceWgsl`'s `custom` option):
 *   SurfaceIn  world, normal, uv, tint (vertex colour), attr (a mesh's surface row —
 *              roughness, metallic, heat, part), emissive (a mesh's own), eye, albedo,
 *              roughness, metallic (the base values, before this function), absTime;
 *              local, localNormal (T1588b: the vertex and its normal in the shape's OWN
 *              frame, before the Geometry's Transform and before an instance's own —
 *              detail painted by them moves with the object and sticks to each
 *              instance), instanceId (the instance's slot; 0 on a surface),
 *              instance (T1581b: the source's own `struct Instance`, when it declares
 *              one — see PER-INSTANCE VALUES below).
 *   SurfaceOut albedo, roughness, metallic, normal, emissive.
 *   surfaceDefaults(s) → the SurfaceOut the stock material would have produced.
 *   `frameU` (SharedFrame) is readable for the other clocks.
 *
 * Knobs: the source's own `struct Params` is reflected into drivable controls exactly as
 * Custom WGSL and the point kernels reflect theirs (one reflector, §V349) — a uniform write,
 * never a rebuild (§V5). `// @use hash` / `grid` pull the shared modules in.
 *
 * PER-INSTANCE VALUES (T1581b, docs/mesh-instancing-design-2026-10-05.md D9): a source may
 * declare `struct Instance { heat: f32, // @default 0 … }` beside `struct Params`, and read
 * `s.instance.heat`. A mesh-instancing Geometry binds each field BY NAME to an attribute of
 * its points (same name and type; its Instance Attributes text renames or takes a channel),
 * so a kernel that writes `heat` per point lights each instance differently with no second
 * node agreeing on a slot number. On a surface, and for a field nothing binds, the value is
 * the field's `@default`. Fields are f32, vec2f, vec3f, vec4f, u32 or vec4u: the types a
 * point attribute has.
 *
 * TEXTURES (T1658b, docs/material-texture-inputs-2026-10-06.md): a source names what it
 * reads, a line each, `// @texture lens`. The first name is the input Texture 1, the second
 * Texture 2, up to four. The generator declares `var lens: texture_2d<f32>;` above the code,
 * and `surface()` reads it by a coordinate of its own with the shared module `map`
 * (`// @use map`: `mapNearest`, `mapLinear`) or with `textureLoad`. A name with nothing wired
 * is refused by name; a wire the source does not name is said by name. A webcam, a movie or
 * a Render is a texture like any other: what it holds this frame is what is read this frame.
 *
 * SURFACE draws and MESH INSTANCES (T1581b: a Geometry in Instances mode with Shape: Mesh,
 * where `local` is the vertex in the mesh's own frame and `instanceId` the instance's slot).
 * Primitive instances, points and beams draw through a different generator and refuse a WGSL
 * material by name at the Render.
