       * again). Measured 2026-10-06, Playwright 1.62.1, Chromium 151.0.7922.34,
       * macOS/Metal, against an http://localhost origin:
       *
       *   - no `channel` (the project above): `chrome-headless-shell`, the OLD headless.
       *     `requestAdapter()` resolves null.
       *   - `channel: "chromium"`: the full Chrome for Testing binary, the one a headed run
       *     launches, in the NEW headless mode. `requestAdapter()` resolves
       *     `apple`/`metal-3` with `isFallbackAdapter` false, and chrome://gpu reports
       *     ANGLE Metal on the machine's own GPU. A canvas presenting (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)
       *     screenshots as exactly [64,128,191,255], requestAnimationFrame is unthrottled,
       *     the page is visible and focused. macOS lists the process as background-only:
       *     no window, no Dock icon, the front application does not change.
       *
       * So `channel: "chromium"` is the whole mechanism. NO GPU FLAGS, on purpose:
       * `--use-angle=metal` and `--enable-gpu` changed nothing that was measured in this
       * mode, and `--enable-unsafe-webgpu` adds a SwiftShader fallback adapter. Measured
       * with the GPU taken away (`--disable-gpu`): without that flag `requestAdapter()`
       * resolves null, with it it resolves `google`/`swiftshader`, which presents nothing
       * to the glass and which the premise test in `presentation-pixels.spec.ts` (it fails
       * on a NULL adapter) would let through. (The old headless shell does get the real
       * adapter from either of the first two flags; `document-swap.spec.ts` and
       * `component-dive-previews.spec.ts` run that way inside the project above.)
       *
       * A window on request: `pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium-gpu --headed`
       * (Playwright's own flag; it overrides `use.headless` and launches this same binary).
       * That opens Chromium on the desktop of whoever is logged in, under their cursor, so
       * it is for watching one spec and never for a gate run.
       *
       * CI does not run e2e at all today (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so like the Dawn
       * `*.gpu.test.ts` suites this lane is a local gate: without a GPU it FAILS loudly on
       * its premise test — it never skips itself green.
